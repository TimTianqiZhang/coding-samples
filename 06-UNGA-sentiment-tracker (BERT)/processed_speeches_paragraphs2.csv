BRA,2009,The General Assembly has been and must continue to be the great forum for general debate concerning humankind’s major problems.,BRA_2009_01
BRA,2009,"I wish to discuss three crucial issues which I believe to be interconnected. Three perils that haunt our planet are the ongoing economic crisis, the lack of stable, democratic world governance and the threat posed by climate change to all of our lives.",BRA_2009_02
BRA,2009,"Exactly one year ago, at the outset of the economic crisis that overtook the world economy, I said from this rostrum that history would never forgive us for the serious blunder of dealing only with the impact of the crisis rather than its causes. More than a crisis of big banks, this is a crisis of big dogmas. An economic, political and social outlook held to be unquestionable has simply fallen apart. A senseless way of thinking and acting which dominated the world for decades has proven itself bankrupt.",BRA_2009_03
BRA,2009,"I refer to the absurd doctrine that markets could regulate themselves with no need for so-called intrusive State intervention. And I refer to the thesis of absolute freedom for financial capital, with no rules or transparency, beyond the control of people and institutions. It was an iniquitous defence of a minimal, crippled, weakened state, unable to promote development or to fight poverty and inequities.",BRA_2009_04
BRA,2009,"It included the demonization of social policies, an obsession with precarious labour relations and an irresponsible commoditization of public services. The real cause of the crises is that most of the sovereignty of peoples and nations and their democratic governments had been confiscated by autonomous networks of wealth and power.",BRA_2009_05
BRA,2009,"I said then that the time had come for political decisions. I said that leaders, rather than arrogant technocrats must take responsibility for bringing worldwide disorder under control. Controlling the crisis and changing the course of the world’s economy could not be left to the usual few.",BRA_2009_06
BRA,2009,"Developed countries and the multilateral agencies that they run had been unable to foresee the approaching catastrophe, much less prevent it. The impact of the crisis spread around the world, striking, above all, countries that for years, and at great sacrifice, had been rebuilding their economies.",BRA_2009_07
BRA,2009,"It is not fair that the price of runaway speculation be paid by those who had nothing to do with it, by workers and by poor or developing countries. Twelve months later, we can see some progress, but many doubts still persist. No one is yet clearly willing to confront serious distortions of the global economy in the multilateral arena.",BRA_2009_08
BRA,2009,The fact that we avoided a total collapse of the system has apparently given rise to an irresponsible acquiescence in certain sectors. Most of the underlying problems have been ignored. There is enormous resistance to the adoption of effective mechanisms to regulate financial markets.,BRA_2009_09
BRA,2009,"Rich countries are putting off reform at multilateral agencies such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. We simply cannot understand the paralysis of the Doha Round, whose conclusion will, above all, benefit the poorest 7 09-52179 countries of our world. There are also worrisome signs of return to protectionist practices, while little has been done to fight tax havens.",BRA_2009_10
BRA,2009,"Many countries, however, have not sat waiting.",BRA_2009_11
BRA,2009,"Brazil, fortunately one of the last countries to be hit by the crisis, is now one of the first to emerge from it.",BRA_2009_12
BRA,2009,"There is no magic in what we did. We simply kept our financial system from being contaminated by the virus of speculation. We had already cut back our external vulnerability as we turned from debtors into international creditors. Along with other countries, we decided to contribute resources for the IMF to lend money to the poorest countries, free of the unacceptable conditions imposed in the past.",BRA_2009_13
BRA,2009,"Above all, however, both before and after the crisis broke out, we implemented countercyclical policies. We intensified our social programmes, particularly income-transfer programmes. We raised wages above inflation rates. We used fiscal measures to stimulate consumption and keep the economy moving.",BRA_2009_14
BRA,2009,We have now emerged from our brief recession.,BRA_2009_15
BRA,2009,"Our economy has regained its impetus and shows promise for 2010. Foreign trade is recovering vitality, the labour market is doing amazingly well and macroeconomic equilibrium has been preserved, at no cost to the victories of our people’s movements. What Brazil and other countries have shown is that, at times of crisis, we must still carry out bold social and development programmes.",BRA_2009_16
BRA,2009,"Yet I hold no illusions that we might solve our problems alone, within our own borders. Because the global economy is interdependent, we are all obliged to intervene across national borders and must therefore establish once again the world economic order.",BRA_2009_17
BRA,2009,"At meetings of the Group of 20 and many other meetings I have held with world leaders, I have insisted on the need to irrigate the world economy with a significant volume of credit. I have defended the regulation of financial markets, the widespread adoption of countercyclical policies, the end of protectionism and the fight against tax havens.",BRA_2009_18
BRA,2009,"With the same determination, my country has proposed a true reform of the multilateral financial institutions. Poor and developing countries must increase their share of control in the IMF and the World Bank. Otherwise, there can be no real change, and the peril of new and greater crises will be inevitable. Only more representative and democratic international agencies will be able to deal with complex problems such as reorganizing the international monetary system.",BRA_2009_19
BRA,2009,"Sixty-five years on, the world can no longer be run by the same rules and values that prevailed at the Bretton Woods Conference. Likewise, the United Nations and its Security Council can no longer be run under the same structures imposed after the Second World War. We are in a period of transition in international relations. We are moving towards a multilateral world. However, it is also a multipolar world, based on experiences in regional integration such as South America’s experience in creating the Union of South American Nations.",BRA_2009_20
BRA,2009,"This multipolar world will not conflict with the United Nations. On the contrary, it could be an invigorating factor for the United Nations. It would create the platform for a United Nations with the political and moral authority to solve the conflicts in the Middle East, assuring the coexistence of a Palestinian State with the State of Israel; a United Nations that confronts terrorism without stigmatizing ethnic groups and religions, instead dealing with underlying causes and promoting dialogue among civilizations; a United Nations that can truly help countries such as Haiti that are trying to rebuild their economies and mend their social fabric after achieving political stability; a United Nations committed to the African renaissance that we are now seeing; a United Nations able to implement effective policies that preserve and expand human rights; a United Nations that can make real progress towards disarmament in true balance with non-proliferation; a United Nations that can truly lead in initiatives to protect the planet’s environment; a United Nations that can use its Economic and Social Council to forge decisions on confronting the economic crisis; and a United Nations that is representative enough to address threats to world peace through a reformed Security Council that is renewed and open to new permanent members.",BRA_2009_21
BRA,2009,"We are not wishful thinkers. Yet it takes political will to confront and overcome situations that conspire against peace, development and democracy. Unless political will is present, throwbacks such as the embargo against Cuba will persist.",BRA_2009_22
BRA,2009,"Unless there is political will, we will see more coups such as the one that toppled the constitutional 09-52179 8 President of Honduras, José Manuel Zelaya, who has been granted refuge in Brazil’s embassy in Tegucigalpa since Monday. The international community demands that Mr. Zelaya immediately return to the presidency of his country, and it must be alert to ensure the inviolability of Brazil’s diplomatic mission in the capital of Honduras.",BRA_2009_23
BRA,2009,"Finally, unless political will prevails, threats to the world such as climate change will continue to grow.",BRA_2009_24
BRA,2009,All countries must take action to turn back global warming. We are dismayed by the reluctance of developed countries to shoulder their share of the burden when it comes to fighting climate change. They cannot burden developing and poor countries with tasks that are theirs alone.,BRA_2009_25
BRA,2009,"Brazil is doing its part. We will arrive in Copenhagen with precise alternatives and commitments. We have approved a national climate change plan that includes an 80 per cent cut in deforestation of the Amazon by 2020. We will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 4.8 billion tons — more than the sum total of all the commitments of developed countries. In 2009, we can already boast the lowest deforestation rate in 20 years.",BRA_2009_26
BRA,2009,"Brazil’s energy blend is in one of the cleanest in the world. Forty-five per cent of the energy that my country consumes is renewable. In the rest of the world, only 12 per cent is renewable, while no country in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has a rate higher than 5 per cent. Eighty per cent of our electric power also comes from renewable sources.",BRA_2009_27
BRA,2009,"All the gasoline sold for our passenger cars has 25 per cent ethanol blended into it. More than 80 per cent of the cars produced in our country have flexible- fuel engines that enable them to use any blend of gasoline and/or alcohol. Brazil’s ethanol and other biofuels are produced in ever-improving conditions under the ecological zoning plan that we have just sent to our National Congress. We have banned sugar cane plantations and alcohol plants in areas with native vegetation. That decision applies to the entire Amazon region as well as to other major biomes. Sugar cane production covers no more than 2 per cent of our tillable land. Unlike other biofuels, it does not affect food security, much less compromise the environment.",BRA_2009_28
BRA,2009,"Companies, farm workers and the Government have signed an important commitment to ensure decent working conditions on Brazil’s sugar cane plantations.",BRA_2009_29
BRA,2009,"All those concerns are part of the energy policies of a country that is self-sufficient in oil and has just found major reserves that will put us in the forefront of fossil fuel production. Even so, Brazil will not relinquish its environmental agenda and simply turn into an oil giant. We plan to consolidate our role as a world Power in green energy. Meanwhile, developed countries must set emission-reduction goals that go far beyond those tabled to date, which represent a mere fraction of the reductions recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We are also deeply concerned that the funding announced to date for technological innovations needed to protect the environment in developing countries is totally insufficient.",BRA_2009_30
BRA,2009,The solutions to those and other impasses will arise only if the perils of climate change are confronted with the understanding that we share common but differentiated responsibilities.,BRA_2009_31
BRA,2009,"The issues at the core of our concerns — the financial crisis, new global governance and climate change — have one strong common denominator: the need to build a new international order that is sustainable, multilateral and less asymmetric, free of hegemonies and ruled by democratic institutions. Such a new world is a political and moral imperative. We cannot just shovel away the rubble of failure; we must be midwives to the future. That is the only way to make amends for so much injustice and to prevent new collective tragedies.",BRA_2009_32
BRA,2010,It is a great honour for me to come to this rostrum to speak on behalf of the people and Government of Brazil. I bring the greetings of President Lula.,BRA_2010_01
BRA,2010,"Within days, over 130 million Brazilians will go to the polls and will write another important chapter in the history of our democracy. During President Lula’s two terms, Brazil has changed. Sustained economic growth, financial stability, social inclusion and the full exercise of democracy have converged and reinforced each another. Over 20 million Brazilians rose out of poverty, and many others out of extreme poverty.",BRA_2010_02
BRA,2010,Nearly 30 million people joined the middle class.,BRA_2010_03
BRA,2010,"Strong and transparent public policies reduced inequalities in income, access and opportunities.",BRA_2010_04
BRA,2010,Millions of Brazilians rose to dignity and real citizenship. The strengthened domestic market protected us from the worst effects of the global crisis set in motion by the financial casino in the richest countries in the world.,BRA_2010_05
BRA,2010,Brazil is proud to have achieved almost all of the Millennium Development Goals and to be well on the way to meeting them all by 2015. The inability of any country to achieve those Goals must be seen as a failure of the entire international community. The promotion of development is a collective responsibility.,BRA_2010_06
BRA,2010,"Brazil has been working to assist other countries to replicate its successful experiences. In the past years Brazil’s actions on the international stage have been driven by a sense of solidarity. We are convinced that it is possible to have a humanistic foreign policy without losing sight of national interests. That policy is supported by South-South cooperation. The IBSA Facility for Poverty and Hunger Alleviation, created by India, Brazil and South Africa, finances projects in Haiti, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, Palestine, Cambodia, Burundi, Laos and Sierra Leone. Brazil has substantially increased its humanitarian aid and the number of its cooperation projects with poorer countries.",BRA_2010_07
BRA,2010,"Africa occupies a very special place in Brazilian diplomacy. Since taking office, President Lula has been to Africa 11 times and visited over 20 countries in the continent. We have set up an agricultural research office in Ghana, a model cotton farm in Mali, a manufacturing plant for antiretroviral drugs in Mozambique and professional training centres in five African countries. Through trade and investment, we are helping the African continent to develop its enormous potential and reduce its dependency on a few centres of political and economic power.",BRA_2010_08
BRA,2010,"Brazil is particularly concerned about Guinea- Bissau. It is not by isolating or abandoning Guinea- Bissau that the international community will help it address the challenges it still faces. We need intelligent modalities for cooperation, which can promote development and stability and encourage the necessary reforms, especially with regard to the armed forces.",BRA_2010_09
BRA,2010,"This year, in which a significant number of African countries celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of their decolonization, Brazil renews its commitment to an independent, prosperous, just and democratic Africa.",BRA_2010_10
BRA,2010,"There are few places where international solidarity is more needed than Haiti. We joined the United Nations in mourning the tragedy that took the lives of hundreds of thousands of Haitians. We ourselves lost great Brazilians, including Dr. Zilda Arns — a woman who dedicated her life to the poor, especially children — Mr. Luiz Carlos da Costa, Deputy Head of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti, and 18 of our peacekeepers.",BRA_2010_11
BRA,2010,"We would like to express our compassion for the suffering of the Haitian people and, above all, our admiration for the stoicism and courage with which they have been facing adversity. The Haitian people know that they can count on Brazil to not only help them maintain order and defend democracy, but also assist in their development. We are keeping our promises and will keep a watchful eye on the situation to ensure that the commitments of the international community go beyond rhetorical statements.",BRA_2010_12
BRA,2010,"10-54827 6 In recent years, the Brazilian Government has invested heavily in South America’s integration and peace. We have strengthened our strategic partnership with Argentina. We have reinforced MERCOSUR, including through financial mechanisms unique among developing countries.",BRA_2010_13
BRA,2010,"The establishment of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) aims at consolidating a genuine zone of peace and prosperity. UNASUR has already demonstrated its value in promoting understanding and the peaceful resolution of conflicts among and within countries in South America and has made foreign interference in our region even more unwarranted. By creating the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, launched in Bahia, Brazil and confirmed in Cancún, Mexico, we have reaffirmed the region’s willingness to extend to Central America and the Caribbean the integrationist ideals that animate South Americans.",BRA_2010_14
BRA,2010,"Brazil reiterates its condemnation, shared by all in Latin America and the Caribbean, of the illegitimate embargo against Cuba. Its sole result has been to hamper the efforts of millions of Cubans in their struggle for development.",BRA_2010_15
BRA,2010,"We condemn anti-democratic moves, such as the coup d’état in Honduras. The return of former President Zelaya without threats to his freedom is indispensable for the full normalization of Honduras’ relations with the region as a whole.",BRA_2010_16
BRA,2010,"When President Lula first spoke in this Hall, in 2003, the world lived under the shadow of the invasion of Iraq. We hope we have learned the lessons of that episode. Blind faith in intelligence reports tailored to justify political goals must be rejected. We must ban once and for all the use of force that is inconsistent with international law. Furthermore, it is fundamental to value and promote dialogue and the peaceful resolution of disputes.",BRA_2010_17
BRA,2010,"In order to achieve a truly secure world, the promise of the total elimination of nuclear weapons must be fulfilled. Unilateral reductions are welcome but insufficient, especially when they occur in tandem with the modernization of nuclear arsenals.",BRA_2010_18
BRA,2010,"As President Lula has often stated, multilateralism is the international face of democracy.",BRA_2010_19
BRA,2010,The United Nations must be the main center of decision-making in international politics.,BRA_2010_20
BRA,2010,"The changes that have occurred in the world over the past few decades and the series of crises we have faced in food security, climate change, the economic and financial sphere and peace and security make it urgent to redefine the rules that govern international relations.",BRA_2010_21
BRA,2010,"The financial crisis of 2008 accelerated change in global economic governance. The Group of Twenty (G-20) replaced the Group of Eight as the primary forum for deliberation on economic issues. The G-20 was a step forward, but it must be adjusted to ensure, for instance, greater African participation. The relevance and legitimacy of the G-20 can be preserved only if it maintains frank and permanent dialogue with all the nations represented in this General Assembly.",BRA_2010_22
BRA,2010,"At the height of the crisis, we succeeded in avoiding the worst-case scenario: a surge of uncontrolled protectionism, which would have thrown the world into a deep depression. But the developed countries have not demonstrated the necessary commitment to global economic stability. They continue to let themselves be guided by parochial interests. Nowhere is that more evident than in the Doha round of negotiations in the World Trade Organization. A balanced solution to that negotiating process, which has lasted for almost 10 years, would promote economic expansion and the development of the poorest countries, with the end of distorting subsidies and protectionist barriers. After all, poor countries are the greatest victims of the narrow and selfish view that still prevails in international trade.",BRA_2010_23
BRA,2010,Reforms have also been insufficient in the financial sector. Unjustified resistance is preventing the implementation of agreed-upon changes. Obstinacy in maintaining anachronistic privileges perpetuates and deepens the illegitimacy of institutions.,BRA_2010_24
BRA,2010,"Another major challenge we face is achieving a global, comprehensive and ambitious agreement on climate change. In order to move forward on this matter, countries must stop hiding behind each other.",BRA_2010_25
BRA,2010,"Brazil, like other developing countries, has done its part. But in Copenhagen, several delegations, especially from the rich world, sought excuses to evade their moral and political obligations. They forgot that one cannot negotiate with Nature.",BRA_2010_26
BRA,2010,"A positive outcome of the sixteenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, with real progress in 7 10-54827 forests, financing for adaptation and mitigation and a reaffirmation of the Kyoto commitments, is indispensable. The Mexican presidency can count on Brazil’s engagement to achieve this objective.",BRA_2010_27
BRA,2010,"In 2012, we will host, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the Rio+20 Conference. On behalf of the Brazilian Government, I invite all delegations to fulfill the promise of truly sustainable development.",BRA_2010_28
BRA,2010,"The reform of global governance has not yet reached the field of international peace and security. In the economic and environmental areas, the wealthiest nations have already understood that they cannot do without the cooperation of the poor and emerging countries. When it comes to war and peace, however, the traditional players are reluctant to share power.",BRA_2010_29
BRA,2010,"The Security Council must be reformed and expanded to allow for greater participation by developing countries, including as permanent members. We cannot continue with working methods that lack transparency and that allow the permanent members to discuss behind closed doors and for as long as they wish issues that concern all mankind.",BRA_2010_30
BRA,2010,"Brazil has sought to live up to what is expected from all Security Council members, including non- permanent ones — namely, that they contribute to peace. For this reason, we made a serious effort to find an instrument that could enable progress towards a solution of the Iranian nuclear question. In so doing, we relied on proposals that had been presented as a unique opportunity to build confidence between the parties. The Tehran Declaration of 17 May, signed by Brazil, Turkey and Iran, removed obstacles that, according to the very authors of those proposals, had previously prevented an agreement.",BRA_2010_31
BRA,2010,"The Tehran Declaration does not exhaust the issue and was never intended to do so. We are convinced that, once back to the negotiating table, the parties will find ways to resolve other issues, such as 20 per cent enrichment and the stock of enriched uranium accumulated since October 2009. In spite of the sanctions, we still hope that the logic of dialogue and understanding will prevail. The world cannot run the risk of a new conflict like the one in Iraq. We have been insisting, therefore, that the Iranian Government maintain an attitude of flexibility and openness towards negotiations, but it is necessary that all those concerned also demonstrate such willingness.",BRA_2010_32
BRA,2010,"We are closely following developments in the peace process in the Middle East. We hope the direct talks between Palestinians and Israelis launched earlier this month will produce concrete results that lead to the creation of a Palestinian State within the pre-1967 borders, a State that ensures for the Palestinian people a dignified life, co-existing side by side and in peace with the State of Israel.",BRA_2010_33
BRA,2010,"However, it is not the format of the dialogue that will determine whether it will yield results. What matters is the willingness of the parties to reach a just and lasting peace. That will be easier with the involvement of all those concerned. Freezing the construction of settlements in the occupied territories, lifting the Gaza blockade and ending attacks against civilian populations are crucial elements in the process.",BRA_2010_34
BRA,2010,"In his visit to Israel, Palestine and Jordan in March, President Lula spoke with government leaders and representatives of civil society about those issues.",BRA_2010_35
BRA,2010,"We frequently receive in Brasilia the leaders of various countries of the region, who seek support in resolving problems that have afflicted them for decades and have not been solved through the traditional means and actors. Brazil, which has about 10 million people of Arab descent and a sizeable Jewish community living together in harmony, will not shy away from making its contribution to the peace that we all yearn for.",BRA_2010_36
BRA,2010,"Brazil’s commitment to the promotion of human rights is also unwavering. We favour a non-selective, objective and multilateral treatment of human rights, without politicization or bias, in which everyone — the rich and the poor, the powerful and the weak — is subject to the same scrutiny. In our view, the exercise of human rights is more effectively ensured by dialogue and cooperation than by arrogant attitudes derived from self-declared moral superiority.",BRA_2010_37
BRA,2010,"During his eight years in office, President Lula has developed a foreign policy that is independent, free of any sort of submission, and respectful of Brazil’s neighbours and partners. It is an innovative foreign policy, which does not distance itself from the fundamental values of the Brazilian nation: peace, pluralism, tolerance and solidarity.",BRA_2010_38
BRA,2010,"Just as Brazil has changed and will continue to change, the world is also changing. We must deepen and accelerate this process. With the technology and wealth at our disposal, there is no longer any justification for hunger, poverty and epidemics of 10-54827 8 preventable diseases. We can no longer live with discrimination, injustice and authoritarianism. We must face the challenges of nuclear disarmament, sustainable development and freer and fairer trade. Rest assured, Brazil will continue to fight to make these ideals a reality.",BRA_2010_39
BRA,2011,"For the very first time in the history of the United Nations, a female voice is opening the general debate. It is the voice of democracy and equality that reverberates from a forum that is committed to being the most representative in the world. It is with a sense of personal humility, but with justifiable pride as a woman, that I greet this historic moment.",BRA_2011_01
BRA,2011,"I share this emotion with more than half of the human beings on this planet, who, like me, were born women and who, with a sense of purposeful determination, are now taking the place in the world they rightly deserve. I am certain that this will be the century of women. In the Portuguese language, words such as life, soul and hope are feminine nouns. Two other words in Portuguese that are especially dear to me are also feminine, namely, courage and sincerity.",BRA_2011_02
BRA,2011,And it is in a spirit of courage and sincerity that I wish to address the General Assembly today.,BRA_2011_03
BRA,2011,"The world is experiencing an extremely delicate period, one that at the same time offers us a major historic opportunity. We face an economic crisis that, if not overcome, could become a source of serious political and social disruption, an unprecedented upheaval capable of causing serious imbalances in relationships between people and nations. More than ever before, the fate of the world is in the hands of its rulers and leaders, with no exceptions. Either we combine our efforts and emerge victorious together, or we will all emerge defeated. It is now less important to know or decide who caused the situation we are facing — because, after all, that is clear enough by now. What does matter is that we start finding collective, speedy and genuine solutions.",BRA_2011_04
BRA,2011,"The current crisis is too serious to be managed by a few countries. Their Governments and central banks still have the greatest responsibility in implementing the process. Yet, since all countries suffer the consequences, all are entitled to participate in their solutions. It is not because of a lack of financial resources that the leaders of developed countries have not yet found a solution to the crisis. Rather, if I may put it this way, it is due to a lack of political resources and, at times, of clear ideas. There is a part of the world that has not yet found a balance between appropriate fiscal adjustments and correct and precise fiscal stimuli conducive to demand and growth. They have been caught in a trap that does not distinguish between partisan interests and the legitimate interests of society. The challenge posed by the crisis entails replacing outdated theories that belong to an old world with new proposals crafted for a new world.",BRA_2011_05
BRA,2011,"While many Governments are shrinking, unemployment, the bitterest face of the crisis, is growing. There are already 205 million unemployed people in the world, of whom 44 million are in Europe and 14 million in the United States. Tackling this scourge and preventing it from spreading to other regions of the planet is vitally important. We women know better than anyone that unemployment is not just a statistic; it affects our families, children and 7 11-50692 husbands. It takes away hope and leaves a trail of violence and pain.",BRA_2011_06
BRA,2011,"It is quite telling that it is the President of an emerging country, a country experiencing almost full employment, who has come here today to speak in such stark terms of a tragedy that has mainly hit developed countries.",BRA_2011_07
BRA,2011,"Like other emerging countries, Brazil has thus far been less affected by the global crisis. But we know that our ability to withstand the crisis is not unlimited.",BRA_2011_08
BRA,2011,"We are willing and able to help those countries that are already facing an acute crisis, while there is still time.",BRA_2011_09
BRA,2011,"A new kind of cooperation between emerging and developed countries is an historic opportunity to redefine, with solidarity and responsibility, the commitments that govern international relations.",BRA_2011_10
BRA,2011,"The world of today faces a crisis that is at once of economics, governance and political coordination.",BRA_2011_11
BRA,2011,"There will not be a return to confidence and growth until we intensity coordination efforts among United Nations Member States and other multilateral institutions, including the Group of Twenty, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and other organs.",BRA_2011_12
BRA,2011,"The United Nations and those organizations must act urgently to send clear signals of political cohesion and macroeconomic coordination. For example, fiscal and monetary policies should be submitted to mutual assessment in such a way as to ultimately prevent undesirable effects on other countries, thus avoiding defensive reactions that in turn lead to a vicious circle.",BRA_2011_13
BRA,2011,"The solution to the debt problem should be combined with economic growth. There are obvious signs that several advanced economies are on the threshold of recession, which will significantly hamper resolution of their fiscal problems.",BRA_2011_14
BRA,2011,"It is clear that the priority for the world economy at this moment should be to solve the problems of those countries that are facing a sovereign debt crisis and reversing the current recession scenario. The most developed countries must establish coordinated policies to stimulate economies that have been extremely weakened by the crisis. Countries with emerging economies can help in that effort. Countries with a high surplus should strengthen their domestic markets and, as appropriate, make their foreign exchange rate policies more flexible in such a way that contributes to the eventual rebalancing of global demand.",BRA_2011_15
BRA,2011,Deepening the regulation of the financial system and controlling that inexhaustible source of instability is a pressing need. Controls must be imposed on the foreign-exchange war by adopting floating foreign- exchange regimes. The task at hand is about preventing the manipulation of foreign exchange that occurs not only through excessively expansionist monetary policies but also through an artificially fixed foreign exchange.,BRA_2011_16
BRA,2011,"Without a doubt, the reform of multilateral financial institutions should continue, thus increasing the participation of emerging countries, which, as driving forces, are responsible for the growth of the world’s economy. We should fight protectionism and all forms of commercial manipulation. They do increase competitiveness, but in a spurious, fraudulent fashion.",BRA_2011_17
BRA,2011,"Brazil is doing its homework. With sacrifices, but at the same time with a sense of insightfulness, we have kept Government spending under strict control, to the point of generating a sizable surplus in Government accounts while ensuring that those steps will not compromise the success of our social policies or the pace of our investment and growth. We are also taking additional precautions to buttress our ability to withstand the crisis by strengthening our domestic market with income distribution and technological innovation policies.",BRA_2011_18
BRA,2011,"For at least three years now, Brazil has reiterated — time and again, from this very podium — that we must all tackle the causes, and not only the consequences, of global instability. We have emphasized time and again the interrelations among development, peace and security. We have often underscored that development policies should be increasingly coupled with the Security Council’s strategies in the pursuit of sustainable peace.",BRA_2011_19
BRA,2011,"That is how we have acted as part of our commitments to Haiti and to Guinea-Bissau.

BRA,2013,We reiterate our support for a reform of the International Monetary Fund. The governance of the Fund should reflect the weight of emerging and developing countries in the world economy. Delaying such adaptive reform will further reduce the Fund’s legitimacy and effectiveness.,BRA_2013_30
BRA,2013,"The year 2015 will mark the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations and the tenth anniversary of the 2005 World Summit. As such, it will be an occasion for us to carry out the urgent reform that we have been calling for since that first summit. We must avoid a collective defeat of coming to 2015 without a Security Council capable of fully exercising its responsibilities in today’s world. The limited representation in the Security Council, in view of the new challenges of the twenty- first century, is a source of grave concern. Examples of that concern include the huge difficulty in providing a solution for the ongoing Syrian conflict and the state of paralysis in addressing the Israeli-Palestinian question.",BRA_2013_31
BRA,2013,The recurrent polarization among permanent members on important issues has led to a dangerous inaction. The Council must be urgently endowed with voices that are both independent and constructive. Only by expanding the number of permanent and non-permanent members of the Security Council and by including developing countries in both categories will it be possible to solve and overcome the current representativeness and legitimacy deficits from which the Council suffers.,BRA_2013_32
BRA,2013,"The general debate provides us with an opportunity to reiterate the fundamental principles that guide my country’s foreign policy and inform our stance on pressing issues on today’s international agenda. We guide ourselves and our actions through a defence of a multilateral world governed by international law, where the peaceful solution of conflicts holds sway and where the pursuit of a fair and solidarity-based order prevails both economically and socially.",BRA_2013_33
BRA,2013,The crisis in Syria has caused unrest and breeds a sense of anger. Two and a half years of lives lost and destruction have caused the greatest humanitarian disaster of the century.,BRA_2013_34
BRA,2013,"Brazil’s population of Syrian descent is an important component of our nationality identity, Our country is thus deeply involved with the plight of the Syrian people. It is necessary to prevent the killing of innocent people — women, children and the elderly — and to silence weapons, whether they be conventional or chemical or whether they be used by the Government or by the rebels. There is no military way out. The only solution is through negotiation, dialogue and understanding.",BRA_2013_35
BRA,2013,"Syria’s decision to accede to the Chemical Weapons Convention and enforce it immediately was an important development. As such, the measure is decisive for overcoming the conflict and helps build a world free of chemical weapons. I would like to stress that the use of such weapons is heinous and unacceptable under any circumstances. We therefore support the agreement reached between the United States and the Russian Federation to eliminate Syria’s chemical weapons. It is incumbent upon the Syrian Government to fulfil the agreement in its entirety and do so in good faith and in a spirit of cooperation. Under all circumstances and in any case, we repudiate unilateral interventions in violation of international law and without authorization by the Security Council. Unilateral intervention would only further worsen the lack of political stability in the region and would increase human suffering.",BRA_2013_36
BRA,2013,"Likewise, lasting peace between Israel and Palestine has taken on a new and pressing dimension given the sweeping changes that the Middle East is currently undergoing. The time has come to meet the legitimate Palestinian aspiration for an independent and sovereign State. The time has also come for us to bring about a broad international consensus for a two-State solution.",BRA_2013_37
BRA,2013,The current talks between Israelis and Palestinians should yield practical and significant results in favour of an agreement.,BRA_2013_38
BRA,2013,"The history of the twentieth century shows that abandoning the multilateral system is a prelude to war, with the ensuing trail of human destitution and devastation. The history of the twentieth century also shows that promoting the multilateral system bears fruit on the ethical, political and institutional fronts. May I therefore renew an appeal for a broad, vigorous convergence of political will that will uphold and reinvigorate the multilateral system, of which the United Nations is the main pillar.",BRA_2013_39
BRA,2013,"When the United Nations was founded, the peoples of the world rallied around the hope that humankind would be able to overcome the wounds of the Second World War and the hope that, yes, it would be possible to build, from the rubble of destruction and massacre, a new world of liberty, solidarity and prosperity. We all have the responsibility not to let such a generous and fruitful hope die.",BRA_2013_40

BRA,2014,"I open this general debate on the eve of elections in Brazil that will determine the President of the Republic, State governors and a significant portion of our Congress. Those elections represent the celebration of a democracy we achieved almost 30 years ago, after two decades of dictatorial rule. Through democracy we also advanced towards the country’s economic stability.",BRA_2014_03
BRA,2014,"During the past 12 years in particular, we have consolidated those achievements by building an inclusive society based on equal opportunity. The great transformation to which we are committed has resulted in a modern economy and a more egalitarian society. At the same time it has required strong civic participation, respect for human rights and a sustainable vision of development. Lastly, it has also required an engagement on the world stage characterized by a multilateral approach, respect for international law, the quest for peace and a culture of solidarity.",BRA_2014_04
BRA,2014,"A few days ago, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations announced that Brazil is no longer on the World Hunger Map. That transformation is the result of economic policies that have generated 21 million jobs, raised the minimum wage and increased its purchasing power by 71 per cent in the past 12 years. Those policies have also reduced inequality. Since 2003, 36 million Brazilians have been lifted out of extreme poverty, 22 million of them during my Administration alone. Social policies and income- transfer programmes, coordinated within our plan for a Brazil without extreme poverty, have also contributed to those results. On the health-care front, we have been able to meet our target for reduced child mortality before the deadline set by the Millennium Development Goals.",BRA_2014_05
BRA,2014,"We have also made access to basic primary and middle-school education universally available, and we are now pursuing the same goal for secondary education.",BRA_2014_06
BRA,2014,"We are equally committed to enhancing the quality of education by, inter alia, improving curriculums and raising the profile of teachers. Vocational education has made strides, with the creation of hundreds of new schools and the professional training and development of 8 million young people over the past four years.",BRA_2014_07
BRA,2014,"There has been an unprecedented expansion of higher education, with the establishment of new publicly funded universities and of scholarships and financial aid that has given 3 million students access to private universities. Affirmative-action policies have enabled poor, black and indigenous students to enrol in universities on a massive scale.",BRA_2014_08
BRA,2014,"Finally, our efforts to tackle the challenges of building a knowledge-based society have led to the creation of a programme known as Science Without Borders, which has sent more than 100,000 undergraduate and graduate students to the world’s best universities. Through a presidential initiative, our National Congress has enacted legislation allocating to education 75 per cent of the royalties earned from pre-salt oil exploration and 50 per cent of the social fund generated by pre-salt oil revenues, with 25 per cent of pre-salt oil exploration royalties going to health care. We will thus be able to transform finite resources such as oil and gas into permanent assets — education, science and technology, and innovation. That will be our passport to the future.",BRA_2014_09
BRA,2014,"We have not neglected fiscal discipline and monetary stability, and we have striven to protect Brazil from external volatility. We were thus able to overcome the challenges arising from the major global economic crisis, triggered in 2008 by the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which subsequently developed into national sovereign debt crises affecting many countries.",BRA_2014_10
BRA,2014,"We resisted its worst consequences — unemployment, wage depreciation, erosion of social rights and stalled investment. We followed through with income distribution by stimulating growth and employment and maintaining our investment in infrastructure. Brazil jumped from the thirteenth- to the seventh-largest economy in the world. Our per capita income more than tripled, and inequality fell sharply. In 2002, more than half of Brazil’s population was poor or living below the poverty line; today three out of every four Brazilians are firmly in the middle-class and upper-income ranges. During the economic crisis, when hundreds of millions around the world were left unemployed, Brazil created 12 million new jobs. In addition, we became a primary destination for foreign investment, and we resumed our investment in infrastructure through strong partnerships with the private sector.",BRA_2014_11
BRA,2014,"All of those gains have occurred within the context of a sound fiscal environment. We have reduced our net ratio of public debt to gross domestic product (GDP) from about 60 per cent to 35 per cent. Our gross external debt in relation to GDP fell from 42 per cent to 14 per cent. Our international reserves increased tenfold, making Brazil an international creditor. Our annual inflation rate has also remained within the maximum and minimum range fixed by our current national targets.",BRA_2014_12
BRA,2014,"Although we have managed to fend off the most harmful consequences of the global crisis, we have nonetheless been acutely affected by it in the past few years, owing to the persistence all over the world of substantial economic difficulties that have had a negative effect on our growth. Here I would like to reiterate what I said at the opening of last year’s general debate (see A/68/PV.5). It is vital and urgent that we restore the momentum of the global economy, which should work to drive investment and international trade and reduce inequalities between countries, and not become a factor that ultimately slows economic development and income distribution in society as a whole.",BRA_2014_13
BRA,2014,"Regarding international trade, there must be a unanimous commitment to an action plan leading to the conclusion of the Doha Round. It is also imperative that we end the disparity between the growing importance of developing countries to the global economy and their insufficient representation and participation in the decision-making processes of international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The delay in expanding developing countries’ voting rights in those institutions is unacceptable. The risk to those institutions is that could lose their legitimacy and effectiveness.",BRA_2014_14
BRA,2014,"In July Brazil had the pleasure of hosting the sixth Summit of the BRICS countries, namely, Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. We welcomed their leaders in a fraternal and fruitful meeting that pointed to important possibilities for the future. We signed agreements establishing a new development bank and a contingent reserve arrangement. The bank will cater to the infrastructure financing needs of the BRICS and other developing countries. The contingent reserve arrangement will protect them from financial volatility. Each instrument will have a capital injection of $100 billion.",BRA_2014_15
BRA,2014,"The current generation of world leaders — our generation — is also being called on to deal with significant challenges to peace, collective security and the environment. We have been unable either to solve old disputes or to prevent new threats. It is impossible to eliminate the underlying causes of conflict through the use of force. That has been made clear by the persistence of the Palestine question, the systematic massacre of the Syrian people, the tragic national fragmentation of Iraq, the serious insecurity in Libya, the conflicts in the Sahel and the clashes in Ukraine. Instead of leading to peace, every military intervention has worsened those conflicts. We are witnessing the tragic proliferation of civilian victims and humanitarian disasters. We cannot allow such barbaric acts to increase and violate our ethical, moral and civilizational values. Nor can we remain indifferent to the spread of the Ebola virus in West Africa. We therefore support the Secretary- General’s proposal to establish a United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response. Brazil is solidly in favour of it.",BRA_2014_16
BRA,2014,The Security Council has had some difficulties in promoting peaceful solutions to those conflicts.,BRA_2014_17
BRA,2014,"To overcome such stalemates, a genuine reform of the Council will be required, a process that has been dragging on for quite some time. The coming seventieth anniversary of the United Nations, in 2015, appears to be an occasion conducive to achieving the progress that the situation currently calls for. I am quite certain that we all understand the serious risks arising from paralysis and inaction in the Security Council. A more representative and legitimate Security Council would also be more effective.",BRA_2014_18
BRA,2014,"I wish to underscore that we cannot possibly remain indifferent to the Israeli-Palestinian crisis, particularly after the recent dramatic events in Gaza. We condemn the disproportionate use of force that has strongly victimized the civilian population, especially women and children. The conflict must be properly resolved, not precariously managed, as has been the case up to now. Effective negotiations between the parties must ultimately lead to a two-State solution with Palestine and Israel living side by side in security within internationally recognized borders.",BRA_2014_19
BRA,2014,"Amid so many conflict situations, Latin America and the Caribbean seek to face up to the main problem that has marked our region for centuries. I am talking about social inequality. Democratic roots have become stronger, and the demand for more just, inclusive and sustainable growth has grown ever stronger. Through the Union of South American Nations, the Common Market of the South, and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, integration efforts have made tremendous headway.",BRA_2014_20
BRA,2014,"Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our times. To overcome that challenge, we need a sense of urgency, political courage and a keen understanding that actors have to contribute according to the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities. The recent Climate Summit, which was convened in a very timely manner by the Secretary- General, further invigorated negotiations at the level of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.",BRA_2014_21
BRA,2014,"The Brazilian Government will strive to ensure that the outcome of the negotiations will lead to a balanced, fair and effective agreement. Brazil has been doing its part to face up to the challenge of climate change. In 2009, during the Copenhagen Conference, we committed to a voluntary reduction of 36 to 39 per cent of our projected emissions by 2020. Between 2010 and 2013, we avoided releasing into the atmosphere an average of 650 million tons of carbon dioxide every year. Throughout those years, we achieved the lowest deforestation rates in our history. In the past decade, we have reduced deforestation by 79 per cent, without giving up our agenda of economic development and social inclusion.",BRA_2014_22
BRA,2014,"We have therefore shown that it is possible to grow, to include, to preserve and to protect. Such an achievement stems from the continuous and steadfast commitment of the Brazilian Government, civil society and other public and private stakeholders. We hope that developed countries, which have not only the legal but also a political obligation to lead by example, will unequivocally and concretely demonstrate their commitment to combat this problem that affects us all.",BRA_2014_23
BRA,2014,"At the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro, we were proud to set the foundations for a new development agenda, based on sustainable development goals applicable to both developing and developed nations. It will be crucial for us to identify the means of implementation that correspond to the magnitude of the challenges that we have committed ourselves to overcoming. We must be ambitious when it comes to financing, cooperation, national capacity-building and technology transfer, especially to ensure that the least developed countries benefit. Let me underscore, in that context, the need to establish a mechanism for the development, transfer and dissemination of clean, environmentally sustainable technologies.",BRA_2014_24
BRA,2014,"In addition to sustainable development and peace, the international order that we seek to build must be anchored on fundamental values.

BRA,2014,"By the same token, the promotion of racial equality seeks to compensate Brazilians of African descent for the consequences of the centuries of slavery to which they were subjected. Today, those Brazilians account for more than half of our population. We owe them our rich and permanent legacy of cultural, religious and human wealth and values. For us, racial miscegenation is a matter of pride. Racism is not only a heinous and extremely serious crime, but it is also a scourge that we have not hesitated to fight, punish and eradicate.",BRA_2014_27
BRA,2014,"The same commitment that we have had to combat violence against women and African Brazilians, we have also had against homophobia. My country’s Supreme Court has recognized same-sex civil unions, thereby ensuring them the full range of civil rights arising therefrom. We firmly believe in the dignity of all human beings and in the universal nature of their fundamental rights. Those rights must be protected from all double standards and all forms of politicization, both domestically and internationally.",BRA_2014_28
BRA,2014,"Yet another fundamental value is the respect for public good. We all face a relentless fight against corruption. History has shown that there is only one correct and efficient way to tackle corruption; that is by ending impunity, thereby strengthening institutions that oversee, investigate and punish acts of corruption, money-laundering and other financial crimes. That is a responsibility incumbent upon each Government, a responsibility that Brazil has fulfilled by strengthening our institutions.",BRA_2014_29
BRA,2014,"In Brazil, we have designed and built a Government transparency portal website that gives citizens access to all information on Government spending within 24 hours after monies are spent. We have also adopted a law on access to information, which allows all Brazilian citizens the right to access Government data, except for that related to the country’s national sovereignty. We have strengthened and given autonomy to investigators as well as to those in charge of internal Government controls. We have passed laws that punish not only those who actively engage in corruption but also those who passively agree with acts of corruption.",BRA_2014_30

For our review of such matters, the 2013 annual report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, published in May 2014, can provide significant inputs. In September 2013, I proposed from this rostrum (see A/68/PV.5) that a civil framework be development for the governance and use of the Internet, a framework based on the principles of freedom of expression, privacy, network neutrality and cultural diversity.",BRA_2014_33

The proliferation of regional conflicts, some of which have the potential to be highly destructive, and the spread of terrorism, which kills men, women and children, destroys our common heritage and displaces millions of people from their long-established communities, demonstrate all too well that the United Nations is currently being severely tested.

We also celebrate the recent agreement reached with Iran, which will enable that country to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and to restore the hope of peace to an entire region.

We will also seek an increase of about 10 per cent in energy efficiency and will add a share of 16 per cent of ethanol fuel and other sugarcane-derived biomass sources to our energy mix.

For six years, we have been working to prevent the impact of the world crisis that began in 2008 in the developed world from overwhelming our economy and our society. During those six years, we have adopted a comprehensive set of measures, including reducing taxes, expanding credit, strengthening investment and stimulating household consumption. We have increased employment opportunities and income levels in that period. This effort has now come to an end owing to both domestic fiscal constraints and external conditions. The slow recovery of the world economy and the end of the ”commodity super cycle” have negatively affected our economic growth.

In order to address this situation, we are rebalancing our budget and have substantially reduced public expenditures and even investments. We have realigned prices.

We desire a country where governmental authorities conduct themselves strictly according to their duties, without ever succumbing to excess; where judges try and judge cases freely and impartially, without any pressure whatsoever, independent of political passion and without ever compromising on the presumption of the innocence of any citizen.",BRA_2015_23
BRA,2015,"We desire a country where the clash of ideas takes place in a civilized and respectful environment. We want a country where the freedom of the press is one of the cornerstones of the freedom of speech and of the expression of different positions, namely, the rights of all Brazilians. Legal sanctions must be applied against all those who have committed illicit acts, bearing in mind the need to uphold the principle of due process. Those are the very foundations of our democracy. In that regard, I wish to avail myself of a recent quote by my friend José Mujica, former President of Uruguay. He said: “Democracy is not perfect, for we are not perfect. However, we must defend it in order to improve it and not deny it”. Allow me to state for the record that Brazil will continue on the path of democracy and will never relinquish the achievements for which we have so greatly struggled.",BRA_2015_24
BRA,2015,"I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that Brazil welcomes citizens from around the world, with open arms, for the 2016 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games to be held in Rio de Janeiro. We look forward to welcoming each and every one. It will be a unique opportunity to promote sport as a key instrument for peace, social inclusion and tolerance in the fight against racial, ethnic and gender discrimination. It will also be an opportunity to promote the rights and inclusion of persons with disabilities, one of the top priorities of my Government.",BRA_2015_25
BRA,2015,"One last point is that a few days ago, here at United Nations Headquarters, the murals entitled War and Peace by the Brazilian artist Candido Portinari, which were donated to this Organization by the Government of my country in 1957, were re-inaugurated. Those works of art denounce violence and poverty and further urge the people of the world to seek mutual understanding and tolerance. They stand as a symbol of the ultimate responsibility of the United Nations, namely, to prevent armed conflict and promote peace, social justice and the eradication of hunger and poverty. Portinari often stated that “there is no great work of art that is not identified by the people surrounding it”. The message of the murals remains timely and topical. It speaks not only to the victims of wars, but also to the refugees who risk their lives on fragile boats in the Mediterranean and to all of the anonymous people who turn to the United Nations seeking protection, peace and well-being.",BRA_2015_26
BRA,2015,"We hope that, as we walk into the premises of the United Nations and gaze upon those very murals at the entrance, we may be capable of hearing the voices of the people we represent and of working persistently to ensure that their calls for peace and progress are met. After all, those were the very ideals that were present 70 years ago at the foundation of the United Nations Organization, this major accomplishment of humankind.",BRA_2015_27
BRA,2016,Brazil brings its natural spirit of openness to the United Nations and to the world. We are a country that is built on and by the strength of diversity. We believe in the power of dialogue. We strongly advocate the principles that govern the Organization — principles that are needed now more than ever before. Today’s world shows signs of uncertainty and instability.,BRA_2016_01
BRA,2016,"The international system is currently experiencing what could be described as an order deficit. Reality has moved ahead faster than our collective ability to address it. From outbreaks of regional conflicts to violent fundamentalism, we face both old and new threats that we have been unable to contain. In view of the refugee crisis and the upsurge in terrorism, we cannot help but be overwhelmed by a sentiment of perplexity or bewilderment. Hotbeds of tension show no signs of fading away. A state of virtual political inaction leads to prolonged wars with no solution. The system’s inability to react to conflicts further worsens cycles of destruction. The social vulnerability of so many in several countries is exploited by narratives of fear and entrenchment.",BRA_2016_02
BRA,2016,"There has been a return to xenophobia, and extreme forms of nationalism are gaining ground. Different expressions of demagoguery bring about serious risks on all continents. Even in the economic arena, the fact is that today’s world lacks standards that can otherwise reduce globalization’s asymmetries. Many have yielded to the easy answer of protectionism. We cannot possibly shy away from such a world. On the contrary, we must join hands and unite to transform it through diplomacy — balanced but firm diplomacy, sobering but determined. Such diplomacy should be well-grounded and embracing of change. That is how Brazil has conducted diplomacy both within our region and beyond as a country that has pursued its interests without ever relinquishing its principles.",BRA_2016_03
BRA,2016,"What we wish for the world is what we wish for Brazil — peace, sustainable development and respect for human rights. Those are the values and aspirations of our society. Those are the values and aspirations that guide us on the international stage. We would like to live in a world in which law prevails over force. We would like to have rules that reflect the pluralistic nature of the community of nations. We would like to have a results-oriented United Nations, capable of facing up to the major challenges of our time. Our debates and negotiations cannot possibly be confined to the Organization’s rooms and halls. Instead, they should reverberate through the markets of Kabul, the streets of Paris and the ruins of Aleppo.",BRA_2016_04
BRA,2016,"The United Nations cannot be reduced to a mere observation post that condemns the world’s scourges. Instead, the Organization should assert itself as a source of effective solutions. Those who sowed the seeds of conflict have reinvented themselves, but multilateral institutions have not. It is for that reason that Brazil has warned that it is essential to make global governance structures more representative, many of which have by now aged and have become disconnected from reality. The Security Council must be reformed. We stand ready to overcome the current impasse surrounding that issue.",BRA_2016_05
BRA,2016,"Many challenges go beyond national borders, including trafficking in drugs and weapons, and have an impact on our cities, schools and families. Fighting organized crime requires us to work hand in hand. The very safety of our citizens ultimately depends on the quality of our collective action. An example of this is the war in Syria, which continues to engender unacceptable suffering, with women and children as the main victims. A political solution can no longer be postponed. We call on the parties involved in the conflict to respect the agreements endorsed by the Security Council and to guarantee the civilian population access to humanitarian aid.",BRA_2016_06
BRA,2016,We are also concerned by the lack of prospects for peace between Israel and Palestine. Brazil continues to support a solution based on two States living in peaceful coexistence within mutually agreed and internationally recognized borders. It is our common responsibility to give new impetus to the negotiating process.,BRA_2016_07
BRA,2016,"Another reason for concern, if I may say so, is the lack of progress on the nuclear disarmament agenda. There are thousands of nuclear weapons in the world today. That amounts to thousands of threats to international peace and security. The most recent nuclear test in the Korean peninsula is a reminder of the danger that nuclear proliferation poses. Brazil can speak with the authority of a country where the use of nuclear energy exclusively for peaceful purposes is an obligation enshrined in the Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil.",BRA_2016_08
BRA,2016,"Yet not all news is bad. There are well-known examples, which have already been mentioned in today’s meeting, of what can be accomplished through dialogue. We celebrate that diplomacy has prevailed on the Iranian nuclear dossier and encourage full compliance and understanding with the agreements reached. The peace accord between the Colombian government and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia allows us to envisage the end of the last armed conflict on our continent. I congratulate President Juan Manuel Santos and all Colombians for that achievement. Brazil stands ready to contribute to peace in Colombia. The re-establishment of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States of America shows that there are no eternal antagonisms or unbreakable deadlocks. We hope that closer ties will bring progress to the region as a whole, to include the economic and trade arenas. We hope that the re–establishment of relations between Cuba and the United State will be followed by the end of the economic embargo against Cuba.",BRA_2016_09
BRA,2016,"This year, Brazil and Argentina celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials. The Agency is the world’s only binational organization responsible for applying nuclear safeguards. As Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has stated, the Agency is an inspiration for regional and global efforts towards the elimination of nuclear weapons. Confidence-building between Brazilians and Argentines in the nuclear arena, as I have just indicated, is part of the inception of our integration experience, and of the foundation of projects like the Southern Common Market. For Brazil, Latin American integration is not only Government policy but the expression of a constitutional principle and a permanent foreign policy priority.",BRA_2016_10
BRA,2016,"As we are all aware, Governments of different political inclinations coexist in our region. That is natural and sound. What is essential is that there be mutual respect and that we agree on basic common objectives, such as economic growth, human rights, social progress, security and freedom for all citizens. Those are the objectives that guide and inform the presence of the United Nations in Haiti. Since 2004, Brazil has led the military component of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti and has sent more than 33,000 contingents to that Caribbean country. We trust that the United Nations presence on the ground in Haiti will focus more on developing institutions and capacity-building.",BRA_2016_11
BRA,2016,"Brazil’s neighbours also include our brothers and sisters from Africa, to whom we are tied by the Atlantic Ocean and by a long-standing history. This year, we will host the Summit of the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries. Of the Community’s nine members, six are African States. Brazil therefore looks towards Africa with friendship and respect, with a determination to undertake projects that will unite us even more.",BRA_2016_12
BRA,2016,"Development is more than just an objective, it is an imperative. A developed society is one where all are entitled to high-quality public services such as education, health care, transportation and security; one where equal opportunity is assured and where access to decent work opportunities is not a privilege for a few. In a nutshell, development is paramount to dignity, and the dignity of humankind is one of the principles of the Brazilian State, as laid down in article 1 of the Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil.",BRA_2016_13
BRA,2016,"The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is the greatest United Nations endeavour in favour of development. Turning it into reality will require more than the sum of national efforts. Supporting developing countries will be crucial to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Prosperity and well- being today should not impair the future of humankind. Economic growth should be socially balanced and environmentally friendly. After all, we live on the same Planet. There is no plan B. We must therefore take ambitious measures under the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. Tomorrow, I will formally deposit Brazil’s instrument of ratification of the Paris Agreement on climate change. As the world’s most biodiverse country, and with one of the world’s cleanest energy mixes, Brazil is an environmental powerhouse with an uncompromising commitment to the environment.",BRA_2016_14
BRA,2016,"Development also depends on trade. In periods of economic crisis, protectionism often increases. It must be curbed. Protectionism is a perverse barrier to development. It reduces the number of jobs and opportunities and makes men, women and families around the world, including in Brazil, fall victim to unemployment and hopelessness. The multilateral trading system is part of the fight against that evil. Ending protectionism in agriculture is particularly important for development. We cannot keep backtracking on the implementation of World Trade Organization commitments on agriculture any longer. It is urgent to prevent sanitary and phytosanitary measures from serving protectionist purposes. It is urgent to discipline subsidies and other distortive domestic support policies in the agricultural sector. Home to a modern, diversified and competitive agriculture, Brazil contributes to food security. We produce for ourselves and we help to feed the world.",BRA_2016_15
BRA,2016,"Unfortunately, the full enjoyment of human rights remains an unaccomplished aspiration in today’s world. Every human being has the right to live freely, according to one’s own beliefs and convictions. Such fundamental liberty, however, is disrespected every day. Persecutions, political detentions and other arbitrary acts remain recurrent in many areas of the world. Our eyes should also turn to minorities and other more vulnerable segments of our society. That is what we have done in Brazil through income-transfer initiatives and housing and education programmes, including financial aid available to students from poor families and backgrounds. We have also advocated gender equality as expressly envisaged in our Constitution. It is incumbent upon us to safeguard the rights of all.",BRA_2016_16
BRA,2016,"Refugees and migrants are, more often than not, victims of human rights violations, poverty, war and political repression. Yesterday’s high-level meeting cast light on some of those substantive matters. Brazil is the product of immigrants, men and women from all continents. We repudiate all forms of racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance. We provide shelter to refugees and migrants, as I underscored in yesterday’s meeting (see A/71/PV.4B).",BRA_2016_17
BRA,2016,"In a world still plagued by hatred and sectarianism, the Rio de Janeiro Olympic and Paralympic games showed that it was possible for nations to come together 16-29296 9/56 in an atmosphere of peace and harmony. In fact, for the first time, a delegation of refugees was able to compete in the games. Therefore, through sports, we can succeed in promoting peace, fighting exclusion and tackling prejudice.",BRA_2016_18
BRA,2016,"Finally, I bring to the United Nations a message of uncompromising commitment to democracy. Brazil has just undergone a long and complex process, led by our national congress and supreme court, which ultimately led to an impeachment. I must stress that everything unfolded in full compliance with constitutional order. We offer that example as a clear indication that there can be no democracy without the rule of law with standards that apply equally to all, even the most powerful. That is what Brazil is showing the world through the process of cleansing its own political system.",BRA_2016_19
BRA,2016,"We have an independent judiciary, an active public prosecutor’s office and executive and legislative bodies that fulfil their duties. Individual agendas do not prevail but rather the will of institutions, under the careful oversight of a pluralistic society and a genuinely free press. Our task now consists in resuming economic growth and ensuring that Brazilian workers regain the millions of lost jobs. We are clear on the path to be followed. It is the path of fiscal and social responsibility. Trust has already been restored and a more prosperous horizon lies ahead in the near future. Our development process consists primarily of investment, trade, science, and technology partnerships. In that regard, our relations with countries of all continents will prove decisive.",BRA_2016_20
BRA,2016,"I do not wish to close my remarks without addressing the Secretary-General, who will soon be leaving office. Mr. Ban Ki-moon, as we all know, has devoted the last 10 years of his life to a tireless pursuit of peace, development and human rights. He can be sure that we are highly appreciative and thankful for his efforts.",BRA_2016_21
BRA,2016,"In the second decade of the twenty-first century, we can no longer doubt that our problems are global. There is no place for isolationism. Ours is a common destiny. At the United Nations, more than anywhere else, we can come close to the universalist ideal that drives us all. About sixty years ago, my fellow countryman, Oswaldo Aranha, stated from this rostrum that even in a world as disturbed as it was then, no one wished to see the doors of the United Nations close. He warned us all that without the United Nations, the shadows of war would descend upon humankind to relentlessly and indefinitely eclipse the hope of so many men and women. It is in the Assembly of nations that we nurture our hope, a hope achieved through dialogue, mutual understanding and respect for others, ourselves, our children and our grandchildren.",BRA_2016_22

BRA,2017,"The challenges faced by the United Nations since its creation have been manifold. Additionally, we all know that the aspirations of its founders have not been fully realized. However, the truth is that over the past 72 years, the United Nations has always represented and continues to represent hope. The truth is that the United Nations has always represented and continues to represent the possibility of a fairer world; a world of peace and prosperity; a world in which no one should face discrimination, oppression and poverty; a world in which production and consumption patterns are compatible with the well-being of present and future generations.",BRA_2017_03
BRA,2017,"The United Nations has established itself as a privileged forum to build the world to which we aspire. In order to build that world, we need proper methods and a sense of realism, all without ever losing sight of our ideals. At the current moment in history, which features such distinct uncertainty and instability, there is a clear need for more diplomacy and more negotiation, not less. We need more multilateralism and dialogue, not less. We certainly need more of the United Nations. We need the United Nations to be increasingly legitimate and effective.",BRA_2017_04
BRA,2017,"It is for that reason that, along with many other countries, we uphold the imperative of reforming the United Nations. It is particularly necessary to enlarge the Security Council in order to adapt it to the realities of the twenty-first century. It is urgent that we listen to the will of the overwhelming majority of the General Assembly.",BRA_2017_05
BRA,2017,One should not assume that ideas that have proved erroneous in the past may now yield good results. We reject exacerbated forms of nationalism. We do not believe in protectionism as a solution to economic challenges. Those challenges actually require effective responses to the root causes of social exclusion. The pursuit of development in all its dimensions should guide our collective action.,BRA_2017_06
BRA,2017,"Brazil’s commitment to sustainable development is our top priority. It permeates our public policies and our actions abroad. During our chairmanship of the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, for instance, we made the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development the driving blueprint for our efforts in that forum. On all fronts, Brazil has sought to contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.",BRA_2017_07
BRA,2017,"Combating climate change is a necessary part of that contribution. We stand committed to supporting the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Last year, I submitted the Brazilian instrument of ratification of the Agreement. There is no possibility of postponing action in the sphere of tackling climate change. We must act now.",BRA_2017_08
BRA,2017,"I am proud to say that my country is leading the way towards a low-carbon economy. Clean and renewable energy sources account for more than 40 per cent of the Brazilian energy portfolio, which is three times more than the global average. We are leaders in hydroelectricity and bioenergy. Brazil is proud to have the world’s highest tropical forest cover. Deforestation is a matter of concern, especially in the Amazon. We have been drawing attention and allocating resources to that issue. Some good news is that data from the past year point to a reduction of more than 20 per cent in deforestation in the Amazonian region. We are on the right track and on that track we shall remain.",BRA_2017_09
BRA,2017,"Another key factor of development is trade. We are committed to an open and rules-based international trade system, with the World Trade Organization and its dispute-settlement mechanism at its centre. At the upcoming Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization, to be held in Buenos Aires in December, we will once again have to face up to long-standing issues, which have proved detrimental mainly to developing countries. We will have to make progress on market access to agricultural products and on eliminating agricultural subsidies that distort trade. We believe that, together, we will succeed in achieving concrete results. All these efforts contribute to the accomplishment of our main objective: to ensure opportunities for all, everywhere.",BRA_2017_10
BRA,2017,"Tomorrow, I will have the honour of signing the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Brazil was among the drafters of the Treaty. It will be a historic moment. We reiterate our call for the nuclear Powers to undertake additional disarmament obligations. In this regard, Brazil expresses itself with the authority of a country that, while mastering nuclear technology, has voluntarily given up possessing nuclear weapons. Brazil expresses itself with the authority of a country whose own Constitution prohibits the use of nuclear technology for non-peaceful purposes; a country that was at the origin of the Treaty of Tlatelolco, which, half a century ago, established the denuclearization of Latin America and the Caribbean; a country that, along with its South American and African neighbours, has turned the South Atlantic into a nuclear-weapon-free zone; lastly, a country that, along with Argentina, created a binational nuclear safeguards mechanism, which has become a benchmark for the world at large.",BRA_2017_11
BRA,2017,"As we welcome the achievement represented by the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, we must acknowledge that there are lingering issues of serious concern on the peace and security agenda. The recent nuclear and missile tests on the Korean peninsula constitute a serious threat to which none of us can be indifferent. Brazil condemns these acts in the strongest possible terms. We must urgently seek a peaceful resolution to the current situation, whose consequences are unimaginable.",BRA_2017_12

BRA,2017,"In Syria, despite the de-escalation of recent months, we are still witnessing a conflict with tragic humanitarian consequences.

Similarly, in Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen, Mali and the Central African Republic, wars have caused intolerable suffering that extends beyond borders.",BRA_2017_14
BRA,2017,"Let us visit the refugee and displaced person camps in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Kenya. Let us listen to the stories of those who have lost fathers, mothers, sons and daughters.

We will not be frightened by terror, nor will we allow it to weaken our belief in freedom and tolerance.",BRA_2017_19
BRA,2017,"In many of our countries, transnational crime also undermines the security and tranquillity of individuals and families. Only through coordination and collaboration will we effectively combat trafficking in persons, arms and drugs, and money-laundering.

BRA,2017,"Brazil is going through a moment of decisive transformation. With structural reforms, we are overcoming an unprecedented economic crisis. We are recovering our fiscal balance, and with it, the credibility of our economy. We are once again creating jobs. We are recovering the State’s capacity to implement social policies that are indispensable to a country like ours. We have learned and are applying this elementary rule in practice: without fiscal responsibility, social responsibility is nothing more than empty words. The new Brazil that is emerging from these reforms is a country that is more open to the world.",BRA_2017_25

It is the attitude of openness that we have adopted towards each of our partners in our region and beyond it.",BRA_2017_26
BRA,2017,"South America is our immediate neighbour. For that reason, we have worked for a prosperous and democratic South America.

When it comes to isolationism, intolerance and unilateralism, we must respond to each of those tendencies with the very best that our peoples have.",BRA_2018_05
BRA,2018,"Brazil has been responding to the first of those tendencies — isolationism — with more  openness  and more integration. Brazil is keenly aware that our common development ultimately depends on more international trade and investment flows. It depends on increased contact with new ideas and with new technologies. We will build prosperity that can be effectively shared only by opening ourselves to others, rather than by withdrawing into introspection and isolation.",BRA_2018_06
BRA,2018,"That is how Brazil has acted. We have implemented a universalist foreign policy. We have worked to deepen integration mechanisms in our geographic region.

In those forums we have worked to produce tangible results that have a direct impact  on the daily life of our societies. It is with openness and integration that we approach a better future for  all. Isolation may provide a false sense of security. Protectionism may sound seductive. But it is with openness and integration that we achieve harmony, growth and progress.",BRA_2018_09
BRA,2018,"Turning to the challenge posed by intolerance, Brazil has responded decisively with dialogue and solidarity, which inspire us, at every moment, to honour the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The implementation of that document, created almost 70 years ago, is an imperative that requires permanent attention and action. Much has already been done for the sake of human rights by Governments, institutions and individuals. One such remarkable individual was Sérgio Vieira de Mello, a  Brazilian national to whom I wish to pay tribute as we remember the fifteenth anniversary of his tragic death.",BRA_2018_10

These are men, women and children who, threatened by protracted crises, are faced with the hard and risky choice of leaving their homelands. It is our duty to protect them, and that is the very purpose of the global compact on migration. It now falls on us to conclude the negotiations on the global compact on refugees.",BRA_2018_12
BRA,2018,"In South America, a large-scale  migratory wave is under way. It is estimated that more than 1 million Venezuelans have left their country in search of better living conditions. Brazil has welcomed all those who have arrived in our territory. We have sought to provide assistance of all types to tens of thousands of migrants. In cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, we have built shelters to protect them as best as we can. We have sought to relocate them throughout the country. We have issued documents that enable them to work in Brazil. We have offered schooling for the children, and vaccination and health services for all. But we know  that this crisis can be resolved only when our neighbour, Venezuela, rediscovers the path of development.",BRA_2018_13
BRA,2018,"Brazil has a proud tradition of welcoming foreigners. As a people, we have been forged through diversity. There is a piece of the world in every Brazilian. Faithful to that tradition, last year we passed a new migration law — a modern piece of legislation that not only protects the immigrant’s dignity but also recognizes the benefits of immigration. We in Brazil have expanded rights and have streamlined the entry and residence process.",BRA_2018_14
BRA,2018,"Dialogue and solidarity are antidotes to intolerance, and they are the foundation for a lasting peace. That has been the cornerstone of the Brazilian position regarding the various crises in the Middle East. As it joins the celebrations of the seventieth anniversary of the creation of Israel, Brazil renews its support for the two-State solution — Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security.",BRA_2018_15
BRA,2018,"We also support international efforts to bring the conflict in Syria to a long overdue end. We have sought to help alleviate the great suffering there. In 2017 alone, for example, Brazil donated approximately one ton of medicines and vaccines for children affected by the conflict. We have also welcomed a considerable number of Syrian refugees.",BRA_2018_16
BRA,2018,"On the Korean peninsula, dialogue and solidarity represent the cornerstone of our position. We reiterate our support for diplomatic solutions leading to denuclearization and peace.",BRA_2018_17
BRA,2018,"It is through dialogue and solidarity that we will overcome intolerance and build peace. As expressed by Nelson Mandela, whose centenary we commemorate this year, it is our duty to strive towards “a world of tolerance and respect for difference”, and to show an unwavering “commitment to peaceful solutions of conflicts and disputes”.",BRA_2018_18
BRA,2018,"Lastly, the challenge of unilateralism must be met with more diplomacy and more multilateralism. We do so firmly convinced that collective problems demand coordinated solutions. That is noblest meaning of the United Nations — a house for mutual understanding.",BRA_2018_19
BRA,2018,"We must strengthen the Organization. We must make it more legitimate and effective. We need important reforms — among them the reform of the Security Council, whose current configuration reflects a world that no longer exists. Finally, we  must reinvigorate  the values of diplomacy and multilateralism. We have shown time and again what we are capable of together when those values guide our actions, such as when we took a historic step last year in concluding the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. I had the honour of being the first Head of State to sign it.",BRA_2018_20
BRA,2018,"That is also how, over the course of decades, we built a robust multilateral trade system with increasingly comprehensive rules and a credible and effective dispute-settlement mechanism. Those are shared historic achievements, which we must honour and broaden by eliminating the many distortions in agricultural trade, which primarily affect developing countries.",BRA_2018_21
BRA,2018,"Diplomacy and multilateralism provide us with effective solutions well beyond disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation and international trade.  The  same is true in many other areas, such as sustainable development,   which   is   crucial   for    the    future of humankind.",BRA_2018_22
BRA,2018,"I note that in recent years alone, we adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement. Those are true milestones that put us on the path of economic development with social justice and respect for the environment. Brazil’s early commitment to sustainable development remains unwavering. There is no shortage of examples.",BRA_2018_23
BRA,2018,"We are fully committed to the shift towards a low-carbon international economy. Over 40  per cent of Brazil’s energy portfolio is clean and renewable. It is one of the most sustainable in the world. We have also stepped up efforts to reduce deforestation. Long- term trends are encouraging. Today, in the Brazilian Amazon region, deforestation rates are 75 per cent lower than in 2004. Over the past two years, we have created and expanded environmental protection areas in Brazil, which are now more than four times the size of Norway.",BRA_2018_24
BRA,2018,"The protection of the oceans is another cause that is dear to us. During the World Water Forum, which we hosted in Brasilia earlier this year, we established protected areas in Brazilian waters as vast as Germany and France combined. In two years, we have doubled the size of protected areas in Brazil.",BRA_2018_25
BRA,2018,"Diplomacy and multilateralism are also decisive instruments for global security, as demonstrated by United Nations peacekeeping missions, in which Brazil is proud to play a major role. And make no mistake, they are also decisive instruments for defeating terrorism and fighting transnational crime. Trafficking in persons, arms and drugs, money laundering, and sexual exploitation are crimes that know no borders. They are scourges that corrode our societies and can be effectively tackled only through concerted policies and actions.",BRA_2018_26
BRA,2018,"That is what we have done in our region. In Brasilia, we hosted the first ministerial meeting of South American countries on border security. Since then, we have stepped up cooperation with our neighbours in combating transnational crime. We must remain united in the collective task of building a world where peace, development and human rights prevail. Absolutely nothing will be achieved alone. We will achieve nothing without diplomacy and multilateralism.",BRA_2018_27
BRA,2018,"This is the last time that I will have the privilege of representing my country in the general debate at the General Assembly as the President of  the Republic. In two weeks, the Brazilian people will go to  the polls. They will choose their political leaders in both the executive and the legislative branches, who will govern Brazil starting in 2019, as enshrined in our Constitution. That is what has been done for almost 30 year, and that is how it must always be. After all, we are Government officials chosen by the people because all power comes from the people, and the President holds the power only for a  fixed period. The transfer of power is the very essence of democracy. Ours is a vibrant democracy anchored by solid institutions. As I turn over the presidency to my successor, I will have the peace of mind of having fulfilled my duties.",BRA_2018_28
BRA,2018,"Today, in Brazil, we can look back and realize how much we have accomplished in such a short term of office. We rejected populism, and we overcame the worst recession in our history, with severe consequences for society, especially for the poor. We managed public finances responsibly and restored our economic credibility. We are growing and creating jobs again. Social programmes once threatened by uncontrolled spending have been rescued and expanded. We put Brazil back on the path of development.",BRA_2018_29
BRA,2018,"The country that I will hand over to whomever the Brazilian people elect will be better than the one   I received. Much remains to be done, but we are back on track. It is time to move ahead. The incoming Administration and National Congress will find a solid foundation upon which a more prosperous and just country can continue to be built.",BRA_2018_30
BRA,2018,"The members of the General Assembly know that Brazil will always be a steady ally for cooperation among nations. In the face of isolationism, Brazil responds with more openness and integration. In the face of intolerance, it responds with increased dialogue and solidarity. And, in the face of unilateralism, it responds with more diplomacy and multilateralism.",BRA_2018_31

BRA,2019,"I come before the General Assembly today to introduce a new Brazil, a country that is re-emerging from the brink of socialism — a country being rebuilt on the basis of the yearnings and ideals of its people. Under my Administration, Brazil has been working to regain the world’s trust and reduce unemployment, violence and the risk for business activities by streamlining bureaucracy, pursuing deregulation and, above all, leading by example.",BRA_2019_02
BRA,2019,"My country came very close to socialism, which led to a situation of widespread corruption, serious economic recession, high crime rates and endless attacks on the family and religious values that underpin our traditions. In 2013, an agreement between the former Workers Party Government and the Cuban dictatorship brought to Brazil 10,000 physicians who had no evidence of professional training. They were prevented from bringing their spouses and children, had 75 per cent of their wages confiscated by the Cuban regime and were denied basic freedoms, such as that of coming and going. Their situation was tantamount to slave labour — believe me — and it was supported by human rights entities of both Brazil and the United Nations alike.",BRA_2019_03
BRA,2019,"Before I took office, almost 90 per cent of those Cuban citizens left Brazil due to unilateral action by the Cuban regime. Those who decided to stay in Brazil will be subject to proper technical eligibility criteria in order to exercise the medical profession. Brazil has thus stopped supporting the Cuban dictatorship by no longer sending $300 million to Havana every year, as was the case previously.",BRA_2019_04
BRA,2019,"History taught us that, as early as the 1960s, Cuban agents were sent to several countries to help establish dictatorships across the region. A few decades ago they tried to change the Brazilian regime and the systems in place in other Latin American countries. They were defeated. Brazilian civilians and military personnel were killed and many others had their reputations utterly destroyed. Nonetheless, we ultimately won the war and prevailed in safeguarding our freedom.",BRA_2019_05
BRA,2019,"Agents of the Cuban regime made their way likewise into Venezuela thanks to Hugo Chavez. Today around 60,000 Cuban agents control and interfere with every area of Venezuelan society, especially intelligence and defence. Once a vibrant democratic country, Venezuela is today experiencing the cruelty of socialism. It is fair to say that, yes, socialism is working in Venezuela: everyone is poor and deprived of freedom.",BRA_2019_06
BRA,2019,"Brazil has also felt the impact of the Venezuelan dictatorship. Of the more than 4 million citizens who fled the hunger and violence in Venezuela, a sizeable proportion migrated to Brazil. We have done our part to assist them, through Operation Welcome — an operation conducted by the Brazilian army that has earned praise worldwide.",BRA_2019_07
BRA,2019,"We have also worked with other countries, including the United States of America, to ensure that democracy is restored in Venezuela. We have devoted concerted efforts to ensure that no other South American country will experience this nefarious scourge. The Sao Paulo Forum, a criminal organization established in 1990 by Fidel Castro, Lula da Silva and Hugo Chavez to spread and implement socialism throughout Latin America, remains alive and must be fought.",BRA_2019_08
BRA,2019,"In the quest for prosperity, we have put in place policies to bring us closer to other countries that have achieved development and consolidated their democracy. There can be no political freedom without economic freedom, and vice versa. A free market, concession projects and privatization opportunities are already a visible part of today’s Brazil. The Brazilian economy is recovering from the distortions and chains of more than two decades of fiscal irresponsibility, ideological manipulation of the State apparatus and widespread corruption. Economic openness, capable governmental management and enhanced productivity are immediate goals for our Administration. We are opening up our economy and becoming an integral part of global value chains. In only eight months, we have successfully concluded the two most significant trade agreements in the history of my country: between the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR) and the European Union; and between MERCOSUR and the European Free Trade Association. We will enter into further such agreements in the months ahead.",BRA_2019_09

BRA,2019,I note the presence here of indigenous leader and spokesperson Ms. Ysani Kalapalo. I shall now turn to the Amazon.,BRA_2019_11
BRA,2019,"First of all, I wish to say that my Administration is solemnly committed to environmental preservation and sustainable development, to the benefit of Brazil and the world at large. Brazil is one of the richest countries in the world in terms of biodiversity and mineral resources. Our Amazon region is larger than all of Western Europe combined and remains virtually pristine and untouched. That is evidence of the fact that Brazil is a leader when it comes to environmental protection.",BRA_2019_12
BRA,2019,"At this time of the year, dry weather and winds favour both spontaneous forest fires and criminal blazes. It is important to note that indigenous peoples and local populations also use forest fires as part of their culture and means of livelihood.",BRA_2019_13
BRA,2019,"We all know that all countries have problems. However, the sensationalist attacks we suffered from much of the international media following the outbreak of fires in Amazonia stirred our patriotic sentiment. It is a fallacy to say that the Amazon is the heritage of humankind, and a misconception, scientists confirm, to say that our Amazonian forests are the lungs of the world. In resorting to those fallacies, certain countries, instead of helping, have amplified media lies, behaved disrespectfully and shown their true colonialist colours. They have even called into questioned that which we hold most dear: our sovereignty.",BRA_2019_14
BRA,2019,"One of those countries, during the most recent Group of Seven meeting, dared to suggest imposing sanctions against Brazil without even consulting with or listening to Brazil. I am grateful to those countries that refused to proceed with that absurd proposal. I thank President Donald Trump in particular, who very aptly summarized the spirit that should prevail among States Members of the United Nations, that is, respect for the national sovereignty and freedom of each of us.",BRA_2019_15
BRA,2019,"Today 14 per cent of Brazilian territory is officially demarcated as indigenous land, but we must understand that our native peoples are human beings like all the rest of us. They want and deserve to enjoy the same rights as all of us. I want to make it clear: Brazil will not increase the area officially demarcated as indigenous lands to 20 per cent, as some Heads of State would like to see.",BRA_2019_16
BRA,2019,"There are 225 different indigenous peoples in Brazil, in addition to about 70 tribes living in isolated locations throughout the country. Each people or tribe has its own chief, culture, traditions, customs and, above all, its own way of seeing the world. The views of one indigenous leader do not represent those of the entire Brazilian indigenous population. Some of those leaders, such as tribal chief Raoni, have often been used as pawns by foreign Governments as part of their information warfare to advance their interests in the Amazon. Unfortunately, some people, both inside and outside Brazil, with the support of non-governmental organizations, have stubbornly insisted on treating our indigenous peoples as cavemen.",BRA_2019_17
BRA,2019,"Brazil now has a President who cares about those who were on our territory before the Portuguese arrived in the 1500s. Indigenous people do not want to be poor landowners sitting on rich lands, some of which, such as the Yanomami and Raposa Serra do Sol reserves, are the richest lands in the world. Those reserves are home to vast deposits of gold, diamonds, uranium, niobium and rare earth elements, among other resources. And those territories are huge. The Yanomami reserve alone is approximately 95,000 square kilometres, the size of Portugal or Hungary, although only 15,000 indigenous persons live there. That shows clearly that those who attack us are not concerned with indigenous peoples as human beings, but, rather, with the mineral wealth and biodiversity in those areas.",BRA_2019_18
BRA,2019,"As evidence of the fact that there is no single authority among the indigenous peoples, I wish to read out an open letter by, and representing a substantial portion of, the indigenous communities in Brazil, addressed to the General Assembly.",BRA_2019_19
BRA,2019,"“The Indigenous Farmers Group of Brazil, composed of various ethnic groups with representatives in all states of the Brazilian Federation, who inhabit an area of over 30 million hectares of the Brazilian territory, respectfully addresses Brazilian society to express is full, unconditional support for indigenous spokesperson and representative Ysani Kalapalo, of the Xingu indigenous park in the state of Mato Grosso, so that she may explain to the United Nations General Assembly, in New York, the reality of the indigenous peoples of Brazil, as well as shed light on the lies disseminated by the national and international media, which insist on keeping the indigenous peoples of Brazil as an endless market reserve, serving the interests of foreign countries that still see Brazil as a colony without rules or sovereignty.",BRA_2019_20
BRA,2019,"“Fourteen per cent of Brazil’s national territory has been officially established as indigenous land, and many communities are thirsty and eager for the development of this part of the country to finally take place, without ideological constraints, which will, in turn, improve quality of life and the standard of entrepreneurship, health care and education. A new indigenous policy in Brazil is needed. Time is of the essence. Bold measures can and should be encouraged in the pursuit of autonomy and economic empowerment for indigenous peoples. Certainly, if a series of decisions is taken to that effect, we can envision a new model for the Brazilian indigenous agenda.",BRA_2019_21
BRA,2019,"“A new chapter of hope is needed for indigenous communities. The situation of extreme poverty in which we find ourselves, surviving only on the family stipend and basic food supply, has never brought dignity or development. Radical environmentalism and outdated approaches to indigenous issues are out of sync with what indigenous peoples truly want and are tantamount to backwardness, marginalization and utter absence of civic rights.",BRA_2019_22
BRA,2019,"“That reality requires world leaders attending the United Nations General Assembly to become familiar with our wishes and aspirations through the voice of indigenous spokesperson Ysani Kalapalo, who will convey the real situation of Brazilian indigenous communities and the environment. Therefore, Ysani Kalapalo enjoys the trust and prestige of indigenous leaders interested in furthering development and empowerment and in attaining a higher profile and greater role and voice, and is in a position to represent the 52 ethnic groups listed in the annex to this letter. The monopoly of tribal chief Raoni is over.”",BRA_2019_23
BRA,2019,The United Nations has played a key role in overcoming colonialism and cannot possibly accept that this type of mindset be allowed to return to its halls and corridors under any pretext.,BRA_2019_24
BRA,2019,"We must not forget that the world needs to be fed. France and Germany, for example, use more than 50 per cent of their territories for agriculture. By contrast, Brazil uses no more than 8 per cent of its land for food production; 61 per cent of our territory is preserved. Ours is a zero-tolerance policy for crime, including environmental crimes. I wish once again to affirm my stance in that regard. Any initiative to help or support the preservation of the Amazon rainforest, or other biomes, must fully respect the sovereignty of Brazil. Moreover, we reject attempts to exploit and instrumentalize environmental issues or indigenous policy in order to further foreign political and economic interests, especially attempts disguised as good intentions. We stand ready to work in partnership to exploit our resources with a view to developing all of our potential in a sustainable manner.",BRA_2019_25
BRA,2019,"Brazil reaffirms its unwavering commitment to the highest standards of human rights and to the promotion of democracy and freedom, including the freedoms of expression, religion and the press. That commitment goes hand in hand with our efforts to fight corruption and crime — an urgent demand of Brazilian society. We will continue to contribute, in and outside the United Nations, to building a world free from impunity, with no safe havens for criminals or corrupt individuals. Under my Administration, Italian terrorist Cesare Battisti fled Brazil and was later arrested in Bolivia and extradited to Italy. Three other terrorists from Paraguay and one from Chile, who until recently lived in Brazil as political refugees, have also been repatriated to their countries of origin. Terrorists, under the guise of politically persecuted persons, will no longer find refuge in Brazil.",BRA_2019_26
BRA,2019,"Not long ago, socialist Presidents who came before me embezzled hundreds of billions of dollars to buy off part of the media and our Parliament, all in a bid to attain absolute power. They have been tried and punished thanks to the patriotism, perseverance and bravery of a judge who has become an icon in my country, Mr. Sergio Moro, our current Minister of Justice and Public Security. Those Presidents also transferred a considerable amount of funds to third countries with the aim of promoting and realizing similar power-grabbing objectives throughout the region. That source of funds has now dried up. The same top-ranking Government officials came here, year after year, and made blithe statements about issues that never served Brazil’s real interests or contributed to world stability. Still, they were all applauded.",BRA_2019_27
BRA,2019,"In my country, we had to do something about the nearly 70,000 murders and countless violent crimes that tore apart Brazilian society each year. Life, after all, is the most basic human right. Our military police officers were the preferred target of crime. In 2017 alone, around 400 military police officers were brutally murdered.",BRA_2019_28
BRA,2019,"That is changing. Measures were taken and we managed to reduce murder rates by more than 20 per cent in the first six months of my Government. The seizure of cocaine and other drugs has reached a record high. Today Brazil is safer and even more welcoming. We have just extended visa exemptions to countries such as the United States, Japan, Australia and Canada. We are currently considering the adoption of similar measures for China and India, among others. With greater safety and ease, we want everyone to be able to visit Brazil, particularly our Amazon rainforest, with all its vastness and natural beauty. The Amazon is not being destroyed or consumed by fire, as the media misleadingly says. Each Member State can verify what I am saying. Do not hesitate to visit Brazil. It is very different to the country portrayed in many newspapers and television programmes.",BRA_2019_29

BRA,2019,"The Brazilian people are particularly concerned about the growing persecution, discrimination and violence against missionaries and religious minorities in different regions of the world. That is why we supported the establishment of the International Day Commemorating the Victims of Acts of Violence Based on Religion or Belief. On that day every year we will remember those who have suffered the harmful consequences of religious persecution. It is unacceptable that in the twenty-first century, with so many instruments, treaties and organizations whose aim is to safeguard all kinds of rights, there are still millions of Christians and people of other religions that lose their lives or their freedom because of their faith.",BRA_2019_31

BRA,2021,"Brazil has not had a single case of corruption in the past two years and eight months.

BRA,2021,"No other country in the world has environmental legislation as comprehensive as ours. Our Forest Code sets an example for other countries to follow. Brazil is a country that is as vast as a continent, and it has great environmental challenges.

It is the visible result of a serious and responsible foreign policy led by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We support the reform of the Security Council, where we seek a permanent seat.",BRA_2021_24

BRA,2021,"Isolation and lockdown measures left behind a legacy of inflation, particularly in relation to food prices, all over the world. In Brazil, in order to cater to those in need, forced to stay at home due to decisions taken by governors and mayors and who lost their sources of income, we granted emergency relief compensation in the amount of $800 to 68 million people in 2020.",BRA_2021_26
BRA,2021,"I wish to recall that we ended 2020, the year of the pandemic, with more formal jobs than was the case back in December 2019 thanks to the initiatives led by our Government, for example, programmes to ensure working conditions and income support, which have cost us nearly $40 billion. In the first seven months of this year alone, we created nearly 1.8 million new jobs. I also wish to recall that our growth rate forecast for 2021 is estimated at five per cent.",BRA_2021_27
BRA,2021,"Thus far, the Federal Government has distributed more than 260 million doses of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines. More than 140 million Brazilian citizens have received at least the first shot, which accounts for almost 90 per cent of the adult population. Eighty per cent of the indigenous population has already been fully inoculated against COVID-19. By November this year, all citizens who choose to be vaccinated in Brazil will be duly covered. We support vaccination efforts; however, my Administration has not supported a vaccine or health passport or any other vaccine-related obligation.",BRA_2021_28
BRA,2021,"Since the pandemic started, we have supported doctors’ professional autonomy in the quest for early treatment measures, in line with the recommendations issued by the Brazilian Federal Council of Medicine. I myself underwent early treatment for COVID-19. Of course, we respect the confidentiality of the doctor- patient relationship with regard to decisions on the proper medication to be used, as well as the potential for off-label use. We cannot understand why many countries, along with a large portion of the media, took a stance against early treatment measures. History and science will certainly hold everyone accountable.",BRA_2021_29

BRA,2022,"The theme chosen for this general debate revolves around a concept that perfectly applies to the moment we live in: a watershed. Our collective responsibility in the General Assembly is to understand the scope of the challenges that make up this watershed moment and, from there, to build responses that pull their strength from the objectives shared by us all. The task is not simple. But strictly speaking, we have no alternative. The effort must begin within each of our countries. First of all, it is what we do at the domestic level that gives the measure of the authority with which we act at the international level.",BRA_2022_03
BRA,2022,"Allow me to speak from my country’s perspective. When Brazil expresses its positions on the public health agenda, we do so with the authority of a Government that, during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, spared no effort to save lives and preserve jobs. Like many other countries, we focused our attention from the very beginning on ensuring emergency financial assistance to those most in need. Our goal was to protect families’ income so that they could face the economic hardships resulting from the pandemic. We helped more than 68 million people, the equivalent of one third of our population. In tandem, we launched a broad vaccination programme, including the domestic production of vaccines. We are a nation of more than 210 million people, and already more than 80 per cent of the population has been vaccinated against COVID-19. All were vaccinated voluntarily, in full respect of each person’s freedom of choice.",BRA_2022_04

BRA,2022,"During my Administration, we uprooted the systemic corruption that existed in the country. Between 2003 and 2015 alone, the period in which the left presided in Brazil, the debt level of Petrobras due to poor management, politically driven appointments and favours, as well as the diversion of funds, reached $170 billion. The person responsible was convicted unanimously in three court cases. Whistle-blowers returned $1 billion, and we paid the United States stock market another $1 billion due to losses incurred by shareholders. But that is the Brazil of the past.",BRA_2022_06
BRA,2022,"We upgraded public services by reducing costs and investing in science and technology. Nowadays, for instance, Brazil is the seventh most digitally advanced country in the world, with 135 million people accessing 4,900 services provided by my Administration. Brazil was a pioneer in the deployment of 5G in Latin America.",BRA_2022_07
BRA,2022,"We implemented a comprehensive agenda of privatizations and concessions, with an emphasis on infrastructure. We have concluded the Transfer of the Sao Francisco River project, bringing water to the Brazilian north-east. We adopted new regulatory frameworks, such as in basic sanitation, railroads and natural gas. Moreover, we improved the business environment, with the economic freedom law and the start-up law. As a result, we created opportunities for young people to be entrepreneurs and have quality jobs. Crowning all those efforts to modernize the Brazilian economy, we are making great strides towards Brazil’s entry as a full member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.",BRA_2022_08
BRA,2022,"Despite the global crisis, Brazil is reaching the end of 2022 with an economy in full recovery. We have high employment and a low inflation rate. The economy is growing again. Poverty increased across the world as a result of the pandemic. In Brazil, it has already begun to fall sharply.",BRA_2022_09
BRA,2022,"The figures speak for themselves. It is estimated that, by the end of 2022, 4 per cent of Brazilian families will be living below the extreme poverty line. In 2019, it was 5.1 per cent. That represents a drop of more than 20 per cent. Auxilio Brasil, the minimum-income programme established by my Administration during the pandemic, which reaches 20 million families, pays them almost $4 a day.",BRA_2022_10
BRA,2022,"Unemployment fell by 5 percentage points, reaching 9 per cent — a rate not seen for seven years. We reduced inflation to an estimated 6 per cent this year. I am pleased to announce that we had unprecedented deflation in Brazil in the months of July and August. Since June, the price of gasoline has dropped by more than 30 per cent. Today a litre of gasoline in Brazil costs about $0.90. The price of electricity also fell by more than 15 per cent. Let me stress that the cost of energy did not drop because of price-fixing or any other type of State intervention. It was the result of a tax-rationalization policy formulated and implemented with the support of the National Congress of Brazil.",BRA_2022_11
BRA,2022,"In 2021, Brazil was the fourth-largest destination for foreign direct investment in the world. Our foreign trade reached the historic milestone of 39 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), even after reducing taxes or lowering them to zero on thousands of products. Domestically, we are also breaking records in three areas — tax collection, State-owned company profits and the public debt-to-GDP ratio. In fact, in 2021 we had a surplus in the consolidated result of national accounts. Brazilian GDP increased by 1.2 per cent in the second quarter. The forecast for 2022 is 3 per cent growth.",BRA_2022_12

BRA,2022,"That is what we see, for example, in food production. Four decades ago, Brazil used to import food. Today we are one of the world’s largest exporters. That was only possible thanks to heavy investments in science and innovation, with a view to increasing productivity and sustainability. I pay tribute to Alysson Paolinelli, Brazilian candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize, for his role in expanding the Brazilian agricultural frontier through the use of new technologies. This year the country has already started the largest grain harvest in our history. We estimate it to be at least 270 million tons. In a few years, Brazil will also make the transition from importer to exporter of wheat.",BRA_2022_14
BRA,2022,"For the period 2022 to 2023, total production is expected to exceed 300 million tons. On a recent visit to Brazil, the Director-General of the World Trade Organization stated that if it were not for Brazilian agribusiness, the planet would go hungry, as we feed more than 1 billion people worldwide. Our agribusiness is a source of national pride. I also note that, in the area of sustainable development, Brazil’s achievements lend credibility to our country’s international action.",BRA_2022_15
BRA,2022,"With regard to the environment and sustainable development, Brazil is part of the solution and a reference for the world. Two thirds of Brazilian territory is host to native vegetation, which is exactly as it was when Brazil was discovered in 1500. In the Brazilian Amazon, an area equivalent to all of Western Europe, more than 80 per cent of the forest remains untouched, contrary to what is reported by the mainstream national and international media.",BRA_2022_16
BRA,2022,"It is essential that, when taking care of the environment, we do not overlook people. The Amazon region is home to more than 20 million inhabitants, including indigenous and riverside dwellers, whose livelihoods depend on economic use of the forest. We brought the Internet to more than 11,000 rural schools and more than 500 indigenous communities.",BRA_2022_17
BRA,2022,"Brazil began its energy transition almost half a century ago, in reaction to the oil crises at that time. Today we have a modern and sustainable biofuel industry. That industry contributes to the cleanest energy mix among the Group of 20 countries. About 84 per cent of our electricity matrix is currently renewable — a goal that many developed countries hope to achieve only by 2040 or 2050.",BRA_2022_18
BRA,2022,"Last year, Brazil was chosen by the United Nations as the global champion of energy transition. We have the potential to become a major global exporter of clean energy. We have a surplus, already under construction, that can reach more than 100 gigawatts between biomass, onshore wind and solar, in addition to the unexplored opportunity of 700-gigawatt offshore wind farms, with one of the lowest production costs in the world. Those sources will produce green hydrogen for export. Part of this 100 per cent clean energy opens up the possibility for us to become suppliers of highly competitive industrial products, especially in the Brazilian north-east, with one of the smallest carbon footprints in the world.",BRA_2022_19
BRA,2022,"The sustainable development agenda is impacted in many ways by threats to international peace and security. We built the United Nations from the ruins of the Second World War. What motivated us back then was the determination to avoid repeating the cycle of destruction that marked the first half of the twentieth century. To some extent, we can say that we were successful.",BRA_2022_20
BRA,2022,But today the conflict in Ukraine serves as a warning.,BRA_2022_21
BRA,2022,"A reform of the United Nations is essential if we are to find world peace. In the specific case of the Security Council, after 25 years of debates, it is clear that we need to look for innovative solutions. Brazil delves into this topic based on experience that goes back to the beginnings of the United Nations. This is the eleventh time that we have held a non-permanent seat at the Council. We have tried to do our best to achieve peaceful and negotiated solutions to international conflicts, always led by the Charter of the United Nations and international law.",BRA_2022_22
BRA,2022,"Brazil also has an extensive history of participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations. From Suez to Angola, from Haiti to Lebanon, we have always supported peacekeeping.",BRA_2022_23
BRA,2022,"We also contributed to peace by opening our borders to those seeking a chance to restart their lives in our country. Since 2018, over 6 million Venezuelan brothers have been forced to leave their country. Many of them came to Brazil. Our response to that challenge was “Operation Welcome”, which has become an international benchmark. More than 350,000 Venezuelans have found in Brazilian territory emergency assistance, protection, documentation and the possibility of a fresh start. All of them have access to the labour market, to public services and social benefits. In recent months, around 600 Venezuelans have been arriving in Brazil every day on foot, the vast majority of them being women and children weighing on average 15 kilos less than before and running away from violence and hunger.",BRA_2022_24

I would like, first, to reiterate Brazil’s gratitude to the countries that helped with the evacuation of Brazilian citizens who were in Ukraine when the conflict started. I refer especially to Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania and the Czech Republic. The operation was successful. We left no one behind, not even their pets.",BRA_2022_26
BRA,2022,"With regard to the conflict itself, Brazil has been guided by the principles of international law and the United Nations Charter. Those principles are also enshrined in our Constitution. We call for an immediate ceasefire, the protection of civilians and non-combatants, the preservation of critical infrastructure in order to assist the population and the maintenance of all channels of dialogue between the parties in conflict. Those are the first steps to achieving a lasting and sustainable solution. We have been working towards that goal.

In that regard, we are against diplomatic and economic isolation.",BRA_2022_27
BRA,2022,"The fallout of the conflict can already be felt in world prices for foodstuffs, fuel and other raw materials.

BRA,2022,"I have been an unconditional supporter of the freedom of speech. Moreover, under my Administration, Brazil has made an effort to bring the right to the freedom of religion to the core of the international human rights agenda. It is essential to ensure that everyone has the right to freely worship and practice their religious orientation without discrimination. I would like to state here that Brazil is ready to welcome the Catholic priests and nuns who have suffered cruel persecution by the dictatorial regime in Nicaragua. Brazil repudiates religious persecution wherever it occurs in the world.",BRA_2022_31

The results can be seen in our Government — a 7.7 per cent drop in the number of femicides and a decrease in the general number of deaths by homicide. In 2017, there were 30 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants; now there are only 19. Violence in rural areas has also plummeted, and land tenure by the most in need has increased. Under my Administration, we delivered 400,000 rural property deeds, 80 per cent to women.",BRA_2022_33

I also would also like to express my condolences to the victims of the earthquake in Morocco and the storms that struck Libya.

BRA,2023,"Hunger — the central theme of my statement at this world parliament 20 years ago — today affects 735 million human beings, who will go to sleep tonight without knowing if they will have anything to eat tomorrow. The world is increasingly unequal. The 10 richest billionaires have more wealth than the poorest 40 per cent of humankind. The destiny of every child born on the planet seems to be decided while they are still in their mother’s womb. The part of the world where their parents live and the social class to which their family belongs will determine whether or not they will have opportunities throughout their life; whether they will eat at every meal or they will be denied the right to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner every day; whether they will have access to health care or they will succumb to diseases that could have already been eradicated; whether they will finish school and get a decent job or they will be numbered among the countless unemployed, underemployed and discouraged people.

Democracy ensured that we overcame hate, misinformation and oppression. Hope, once again, has won over fear. Our mission is to ignite Brazil and rebuild a sovereign, fair, sustainable, supportive, generous and joyful country with solidarity. Brazil has once again found its place within our region, the world and multilateralism. As I never tire of repeating. Brazil is back. Our country is back to make its rightful contributions to facing the major global challenges. We have reclaimed our foreign policy’s universalism, marked by respectful dialogue with everyone. The international community has been immersed in a flood of multiple and simultaneous crises.

We have reached the mid-point of the implementation period and are still far from achieving its defined goals. Most of the Sustainable Development Goals are moving at a slow place. The moral and political imperative of eradicating poverty and ending hunger appears to have been numbed. In the seven years that we have left, reducing inequalities within and among countries should become the core objective of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Reducing inequalities within countries requires providing for the poor in Government budgets and making the rich pay taxes that are proportional to their wealth. In Brazil, we are committed to implementing all 17 Sustainable Development Goals in an integrated and indivisible manner.

Inspired by Brazilian Bertha Lutz, a pioneer in and advocate for gender equality and the Charter of the United Nations, we have adopted a bill that makes equal pay between women and men mandatory when they perform the same roles.

We are at the forefront of an energy transition, and our matrix is already one of the cleanest in the world. Some 87 per cent of our electrical power comes from clean and renewable sources. Solar, wind, biomass, ethanol and biodiesel power generation is growing every year. The potential for generating green hydrogen is immense.

Non-traditional security threats, including terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, transnational organized crime and major communicable diseases, are threatening our world.

Development cannot be sustainable if it is expensive, if it is driven by high consumption with high pollution and high carbon emissions, or if it depletes resources and strains the environment. Development cannot be sustainable if economic growth and social progress are not well coordinated. Only when we have a profound understanding of the implications of sustainability, make progress in poverty reduction at all levels, engage in North-South and South-South cooperation, adapt to climate change, and promote equal sharing and green development can we ensure that development will hold its ground and be sustainable.",CHN_2016_05

We formulated a road map for the denuclearization of the peninsula. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea undertook to abandon its nuclear programmes, and the United States to normalize its relations with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

There should be no new nuclear-weapon State, whether in the north or south of the peninsula, in North-East Asia or anywhere else in the world. We urge the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea not to continue along this dangerous path. We call on the United States to honour its formal commitment and on all the parties to play a constructive role in easing tensions. There is still hope for peace, and we must not give up. Negotiation is the only way out and deserves every effort. The parties should meet halfway by addressing one another’s legitimate concerns. In China’s view, the day when the denuclearization of the peninsula is achieved should also be the day when a peace mechanism is established. China has always been a force for peace.

CHN,2018,"Secondly, we must act in accordance with rules and order. State-to-State relations must be based on credibility, not the wilful revocation of commitments. International cooperation should be guided by rules, not impulse. Practising multilateralism is, first and foremost, about upholding the Charter of the United Nations, observing international law and basic norms governing international relations, and honouring international agreements reached through negotiations.",CHN_2018_07
CHN,2018,"Thirdly, we must uphold the principles of fairness and justice. In international affairs, fairness and justice mean equality among all countries, big or small. They signify the responsibility  of  big  countries  to  help the small, and rich ones to assist the poor. Fairness  and justice also mean respect for other countries’ sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, as well as their choice of  development paths and right to a better life and increased development opportunities.",CHN_2018_08
CHN,2018,"Fourthly, we must act to deliver real results. Multilateralism is not based on empty rhetoric. It must be pursued to solve problems. Efforts must be targeted, results-oriented and measured by visible progress. Whether a multilateral mechanism works depends on the will and engagement of countries. It is imperative that we work together to uphold the international system with the United Nations at its core, as well as the multilateral trading system centred on the World Trade Organization. Multilateralism requires a strong United Nations. China supports Secretary-General Guterres in advancing reform of the United Nations system in the three critical areas of peace and security, economic development and internal management. That reform should be led by Member States, and it should prioritize the concerns of developing countries, make the United Nations more effective and enhance oversight and accountability. Stable and predictable funding is critical to the proper functioning of the United Nations. China will continue to fulfil its financial obligations and calls on other Member States to pay their membership contributions and peacekeeping assessments on time and in full.",CHN_2018_09
CHN,2018,"The momentum of humankind’s drive forward towards development and progress is unstoppable. Peace, reconciliation and harmony represent the predominant trend, while war, conflict and terror are opposed by all. Equality, mutual trust and win-win cooperation are key words of our times, whereas power politics and the law of the jungle find no support. As a major responsible country, China is committed to the path of peaceful development, and it will work together with other countries and contribute its share to global peace and security.",CHN_2018_10
CHN,2018,"Over the past year, the situation on the Korean peninsula has seen a major turnaround thanks to the efforts of all the parties concerned. China,  for  its part, has contributed to that progress. China supports the comprehensive improvement of relations between the north and the south of the peninsula, as well as efforts to facilitate dialogue between the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the United States. China encourages the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to continue moving towards denuclearization. We believe that it is also incumbent on the United States to respond in a timely and positive manner so  as to truly meet  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic of Korea halfway. China will continue to honour its international responsibilities and obligations and will strictly implement the Security Council resolutions related to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. China calls on the Security Council to take timely action in the light of developments and changes in the situation so as to create more favourable  conditions for a peaceful settlement of the issue on the peninsula through political and diplomatic means. To effectively settle the issue we need complete denuclearization and the establishment of a peace mechanism. Only when those components move in tandem can the issue be truly resolved and peace achieved.",CHN_2018_11
CHN,2018,"Regarding the Iranian nuclear issue, now is a crucial time for the continued implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The JCPOA is a consensus-based multilateral agreement endorsed by the Security Council. It serves the common interests of all the parties concerned and the international community at large. If it is not implemented, the international nuclear non-proliferation regime  will be undermined, the authority and role of the Security Council challenged, and peace and stability jeopardized both in that region and throughout the world,. That is  a scenario from which no one stands to gain. China urges the parties concerned to continue to observe and implement the JCPOA. On that basis, the possibility could be explored for a platform for dialogue that is inclusive and transparent so as to enable each party’s concerns to be adequately addressed through  talks and consultations.",CHN_2018_12
CHN,2018,"The question of Palestine must not be marginalized. For more than seven decades, peace and justice have remained elusive in that part of the world. What the international community needs most is not a proposal or an initiative but resolve and action. In order to implement a two-State solution, a new round of peace-promoting efforts must be made with a view to exploring a new mediation mechanism. To that end, China will play its part, and Chinese humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people will continue.",CHN_2018_13
CHN,2018,"The issue involving Myanmar’s Rakhine state cannot be resolved overnight, and steady progress must be made through a three-phase process involving a cessation of violence, the return of the displaced persons and economic development. Myanmar and Bangladesh are inseparable neighbours and could well be inseparable partners. Yesterday, at my meeting with colleagues from Myanmar and Bangladesh and in the presence of Secretary-General Guterres, an agreement was reached between Myanmar and Bangladesh on accelerating the return of the first wave of displaced persons. We believe that Myanmar and  Bangladesh are capable of resolving the issue properly through friendly negotiations.",CHN_2018_14
CHN,2018,"China supports the leading role of the United Nations in coordinating responses to non-traditional security challenges. On the new frontiers of global governance, such as cyberspace and outer space, State sovereignty must be upheld, rules observed and responsibilities honoured.

Every country is entitled to explore a particular development path aimed at delivering happiness and security to its people and bringing about a future of confidence and hope for its children. Countries face various questions with regard to development. Such questions could be turned into drivers for reform, and solutions to problems could bring about development. Economic globalization should not be a process whereby some profit and others lose; even less should it result in widening the gap between North and South. It is important that we  adapt to the trend  of economic globalization and ensure that the process is open, inclusive, balanced and mutually beneficial so that it can deliver benefits to  all.  International trade is complementary and mutually beneficial in nature.  It should not be a zero-sum game in which one side gains at the expense of the others, and no one should be allowed to place their own interest above the interest of others. Protectionism will only be self-defeating, and unilateral moves will hurt everyone.",CHN_2018_16

We need to forge closer partnerships for development and pursue international development cooperation, with the United Nations at its centre and North-South cooperation as the main channel, supplemented by South-South cooperation. To meet the challenges of climate change, it is crucial to achieve sustainable development. China hopes to see the conclusion of the negotiations on the implementation guidelines of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, scheduled for the end of this year, with a view to boosting joint efforts for global ecological conservation.",CHN_2018_18
CHN,2018,"In pursuing our common cause of humankind’s development and progress, China has worked in partnership with other countries of the international community. This year marks the fortieth anniversary of China’s reform and opening up. Over those 40 years, we have worked hard and forged ahead successfully along a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. That path has brought fundamental changes to China. In the past 40 years, more than 700 million individuals in the Chinese population have been lifted out of absolute poverty, which accounts for more than 70 per cent of the global totals for the same period. A basic medical insurance system has been set up to cover China’s 1.35 billion people, and a social pension network accessible to more than 900 million people has been fully implemented. China has built approximately 25,000 kilometres of high-speed railway. That accounts for two thirds of the global total and helps elevate global infrastructure construction.  According  to polls conducted by authoritative international polling agencies, China is at the top of global rankings in terms of public satisfaction with its development and public confidence in its future. The path  of  development that China is pursuing has provided the world with opportunities for shared development. Over the past 40 years, China’s foreign trade has averaged an annual growth rate of 14.5 per cent. That has sustained the impetus for global growth and provided the world with a huge Chinese market. We have every  confidence that we will maintain that momentum and continue to realize high-quality development. China will accelerate efforts to build an advanced economic system, which will create greater trade opportunities and an even better investment environment for other countries.",CHN_2018_19

Of all of the developing countries in the world, China has been the fastest in terms of opening up at a level unparalleled by others. When it comes to overall tariff reduction, China has accomplished more than it committed to when it joined the WTO. The breadth of China’s openness in services is close to the average level of  developed countries.

It is about pursuing common prosperity through greater complementarity among participating countries.

Seventy years ago, China put an end to a period in modern history during which the country was torn apart and trampled on. We stood up and became the true masters of our country.

The advances thus made should not be monopolized by any single country, and no one should obstruct the efforts of other countries in the name of innovation. It is neither legitimate nor justifiable for any country in a position of power to impose unilateral sanctions or exercise long-arm jurisdiction over other countries, as such practices have no basis in international law and are therefore devoid of legitimacy.

Burying one’s head in the sand like an ostrich in the face of economic globalization or trying to fight it with Don Quixote’s lance goes against the trend of history. Let this be clear: The world will never return to isolation, and no one can sever the ties between countries. We should not dodge the challenges of economic globalization. Instead, we must face up to major issues such as the wealth gap and the development divide. We should strike a proper balance between the government and the market, fairness and efficiency, growth and income distribution, and technology and employment so as to ensure full and balanced development that delivers benefit to people from all countries, sectors and backgrounds in an equitable way. We should pursue open and inclusive development, remain committed to building an open world economy, and uphold the multilateral trading regime with the World Trade Organization as the cornerstone. We should say no to unilateralism and protectionism, and work to ensure the stable and smooth functioning of global industrial and supply chains.",CHN_2020_10
CHN,2020,"Third, COVID-19 reminds us that humankind should launch a green revolution and move faster to create a green way of development and life, preserve the environment and make Mother Earth a better place for all. Humankind can no longer afford to ignore the repeated warnings of Nature and go down the beaten path of extracting resources without investing in conservation, pursuing development at the expense of protection, and exploiting resources without restoration. The Paris Agreement on climate change charts the course for the world to transition to green and low-carbon development. It outlines the minimum steps to be taken to protect the Earth, our shared homeland, and all countries must take decisive steps to honor this Agreement. China will scale up its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions by adopting more vigorous policies and measures. We aim to have C02 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. We call on all countries to pursue innovative, coordinated, green and open development for all, seize the historic opportunities presented by the new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, achieve a green recovery of the world economy in the post-COVID era and thus create a powerful force driving sustainable development.",CHN_2020_11
CHN,2020,"Fourth, COVID-19 reminds us that the global governance system calls for reform and improvement. COVID-19 is a major test of the governance capacity of countries; it is also a test of the global governance system. We should stay true to multilateralism and safeguard the international system with the UN at its core. Global governance should be based on the principle of extensive consultation, joint cooperation and shared benefits so as to ensure that all countries enjoy equal rights and opportunities and follow the same rules. The global governance system should adapt itself to evolving global political and economic dynamics, meet global challenges and embrace the underlying trend of peace, development and win-win cooperation. It is natural for countries to have differences. What’s important is to address them through dialogue and consultation. Countries may engage in competition, but such competition should be positive and healthy in nature. When in competition, countries should not breach the moral standard and should comply with international norms. In particular, major countries should act like major countries. They should provide more global public goods, take up their due responsibilities and live up to people’s expectations.",CHN_2020_12

CHN,2021,"Democracy is not a special right reserved to an individual country, but a right for the people of all countries to enjoy. Recent developments in the global situation show once again that military intervention from the outside and so-called democratic transformation entail nothing but harm.

CHN,2022,"First, we must uphold peace and oppose war. Chinese President Xi Jinping notes that peace, like air and sunshine, is hardly noticed when we are benefiting from it, but none of us can live without it. Peace is crucial for our future and it underpins the common security of all countries. Turbulence and war can only open a Pandora’s box, and he who instigates a proxy war can easily get himself burned. Pursuing one’s own absolute security can only undermine global strategic stability. We should remain committed to addressing differences by peaceful means and resolve disputes through dialogue and consultation.",CHN_2022_04
CHN,2022,"Secondly, we must pursue development and eliminate poverty. Development holds the key to resolving difficult issues and delivering a happy life to our people. We should place development at the centre of the international agenda, build international consensus on promoting development, and uphold all countries’ legitimate right to development. We should foster new drivers for global development, forge a global development partnership and see that everyone in every country benefits more from the fruits of development in a more equitable way.",CHN_2022_05
CHN,2022,"Thirdly, we must remain open and oppose exclusion. President Xi Jinping has pointed out that openness is the sure way to realize human prosperity and advancement. Protectionism can only boomerang and decoupling and supply chain disruption will hurt everyone. We should stay true to openness and inclusiveness and tear down fences and barriers that hinder the free flow of the factors of production. We should uphold the multilateral trading system, with the World Trade Organization at its core, and work to build an open world economy.",CHN_2022_06
CHN,2022,"Fourthly, we must seek cooperation and oppose confrontation. As we face a host of global challenges that crop up one after another, our biggest strength will come from solidarity; our best strategy is to stick together, and the brightest future lies in win-win cooperation. It is only natural that countries have problems and differences among them, but they should increase mutual understanding on a basis of equality and respect. We should engage in dialogue, consultation and win-win cooperation, and reject conflict, coercion and zero-sum games. We should jointly oppose group politics and bloc confrontation.",CHN_2022_07
CHN,2022,"Fifthly, we must strengthen solidarity and oppose division. President Xi once stated that countries around the world were like passengers aboard the same ship who shared a common stake. All of us passengers should pull together to navigate the ship through the storm towards a bright future. Our world must embrace diverse civilizations if it is to make continuous advances, and humankind must pursue an inclusive path if it is to achieve modernization. Peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy and freedom are common values of humanity. Differences in system should not be used as an excuse to create division; still less should democracy and human rights be used as tools or weapons to achieve political ends. We should stand against drawing lines on ideological grounds and make united efforts to expand common ground to promote world peace and development.",CHN_2022_08

The so-called dual representation proposal put forward by the United States and a few other countries to keep Taiwan’s seat in the United Nations became a piece of waste paper. Resolution 2758 (XXVI) resolved once and for all, politically, legally and procedurally, the issue of the representation of the whole of China, including Taiwan, in the United Nations and international institutions.

Amid global transformation not seen in a century, what China calls for is to follow the trend of the times, keep to the direction of human progress, and make the right choices of history.

We should be committed to advancing global modernization, and ensure that no one and no country is left behind on the journey toward modernization.

IND,2012,An unwarranted reference has been made from this rostrum to Jammu and Kashmir. Our principled position on the issue has been consistent and is well known. The people of Jammu and Kashmir have chosen their destiny and reaffirmed it repeatedly through India’s well-established democratic processes. We wish to make it abundantly clear that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India.,IND_2012_22
IND,2012,"India supports the Government and people of Afghanistan in their endeavour to build a peaceful, stable, democratic and prosperous country. We are ready to partner with the Afghan people as they rebuild their country in accordance with their own priorities and national circumstances. The continuing existence beyond Afghanistan’s borders of safe havens and sanctuaries for terrorists is the major impediment to the restoration of peace and security in Afghanistan. India is committed to creating an enabling environment in which the Afghan people can live in peace and security and decide their future for themselves, without outside interference, coercion or intimidation.",IND_2012_23
IND,2012,"The United Nations and the norms of international relations that it has fostered remain the most efficacious means for converting today’s challenges into opportunities. However, we need to ensure that the architecture of global governance reflects contemporary realities. Sticking to structures designed at the end of the Second World War only constrains multilateralism from delivering on its promises.",IND_2012_24
IND,2012,"The most important and decisive step towards remedying that situation pertains to the Security Council, which must be expanded in both the permanent and non-permanent categories. A reformed Council must include countries that are capable of bearing, and willing to bear, the additional burdens relating to the maintenance of international peace and security, as well as willilng to sustain global campaigns against new and emerging global threats. Let me also stress that we must address, sooner rather than later, the incongruity of the lack of permanent membership for Africa.",IND_2012_25
IND,2012,"Equally, India will promote and lend its weight to enhancing the voice and participation of developing countries in decision-making in global economic and financial institutions.

IND,2013,"At a time when the world is facing multiple challenges, there is renewed attention to the role of the United Nations in advancing international peace, security and prosperity. However, never has scepticism about the capacity of the United Nations to do so been higher, or the external environment less propitious for multilateralism.",IND_2013_02
IND,2013,"The nearly seven decades of work of the United Nations hold one simple lesson: that we are most successful when we adhere to the letter and spirit of the United Nations Charter, basing our decisions on the widest possible consensus and balancing equitably the needs and responsibilities of nations at different stages and levels of development.",IND_2013_03
IND,2013,"In those seven decades, the world has changed in fundamental ways. Asia and Africa are independent and resurgent. Countries are now not only more interdependent, but also face new, increasingly complex challenges.

IND,2013,We commend your choice of the theme of this session. Setting the stage for the post-2015 development agenda is especially important as we deal with a lingering global economic slowdown and continuing volatility in financial markets. These have imposed disproportionately heavy costs on developing countries and the vulnerable groups within them.,IND_2013_09

IND,2013,"Issues of peace, security, human rights and governance are important and need to be addressed. But we will fall short of realizing an ambitious post-2015 development agenda if we focus merely on governance issues at the cost of robust economic growth. This agenda should not be merely about reprioritizing domestic spending, but also about fostering genuine international partnerships between developing and developed countries to bring about change. All of us need the policy space necessary to set our own domestic priorities.",IND_2013_13
IND,2013,"No one knows the condition of developing countries better than the developing countries themselves. It is therefore important that the United Nations set clear and concise goals and provide practical and well-defined means of implementation, including an adequate flow of resources and the transfer of technology, taking the views of developing countries fully into account.",IND_2013_14
IND,2013,"A meaningful post-2015 agenda must place equally high priority on food and nutrition, health, education, infrastructure, water, sanitation, energy and combating discrimination against women. Especially critical is women’s equal access to economic opportunities and ensuring that they do not become victims of violence or the targets of prejudice.",IND_2013_15
IND,2013,"In India, we have sought to promote inclusive development in multiple ways. Legislation has broadened access to education and secured rural livelihoods.

IND,2013,"India is proud of its partnerships with developing countries. Using modest resources, we have built strong ties with Africa and the least developed countries. We are committed to building 100 institutions in Africa and have offered capacity-building support, including thousands of scholarships, and made available over $9.5 billion of concessional assistance. India and Africa are engaging through the India-Africa Forum Summit process.

IND,2013,"We are deeply concerned about the future of West Asia, a region with which India shares deep bonds of history and one that is critical for our energy security as well as the livelihoods of the nearly 7 million Indians who work and live in the region. Not only is the increasingly lethal conflict in Syria a tragedy for the people of Syria, but it also threatens stability and security in the region and beyond. It has been made worse by the use of chemical weapons. The use of chemical weapons, whosoever may have deployed them, must be condemned in the strongest possible terms. India strongly supports the elimination of chemical-weapons material and equipment in Syria.There is no military solution to that conflict. We must intensify efforts to end the conflict and seek a political settlement. It is essential that the “Geneva II” conference be convened at the earliest opportunity.",IND_2013_19
IND,2013,"We are encouraged that direct talks have resumed between Israel and Palestine. India supports the early realization of a sovereign, independent, viable and united State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital, living within secure and recognized borders, side by side and at peace with Israel.

From Africa to Asia, we have seen several manifestations of this menace in the last few days alone. State-sponsored, cross-border terrorism is of particular concern to India, also on account of the fact that the epicentre of terrorism in our region is located in our neighbourhood, in Pakistan.",IND_2013_23
IND,2013,"From this rostrum yesterday, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan spoke of making a new beginning (see A/68/PV.15). I reciprocate his sentiments and am looking forward to meeting him tomorrow. India is sincerely committed to resolving all issues with Pakistan, including the issue of Jammu and Kashmir, through bilateral dialogue on the basis of the Simla Agreement. However, for progress to be made, it is imperative that the territory of Pakistan and the areas under its control not be utilized for aiding and abetting terrorism directed against India. It is equally important that the terrorist machinery that draws its sustenance from Pakistan be shut down. There must be a clear understanding of the fact that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India and that there can never, ever, be a compromise with the unity and territorial integrity of India.",IND_2013_24
IND,2013,"We need to renew our commitment, especially here at the United Nations, to concerted, cohesive and continuing global action against terrorism.

IND,2013,"Two years from now, the United Nations will be 70 years old. Every new State born during that period of 70 years has taken its place in the Assembly not just with pride but also with hope. The year 2015 will be a time to celebrate our successes and ensure that the United Nations is ready for this century, by completing much-needed reforms of the Organization and its Security Council, developing an ambitious and balanced post-2015 development agenda and demonstrating our capacity to cooperate effectively for durable peace and security in the world we live in.",IND_2013_28

IND,2014,It is a truly a great honour for me to address the Assembly for the first time as Prime Minister of India.,IND_2014_02
IND,2014,I am humbled by the hopes and expectations of the people of India. I am also mindful of the expectations of the world from our 1.25 billion people.,IND_2014_03
IND,2014,"My country, India, is home to one sixth of the world’s population. It is a nation experiencing economic and social transformation on a scale rarely seen in the history of the world. Every country’s world view is shaped by its civilization and its philosophical traditions. India’s ancient wisdom sees the world as one family, and when I say this, I wish to make it clear that each country has its philosophy. I am not talking about ideology. With the inspiration of that philosophy, a country marches ahead. India is a country that since its Vedic times, has been saying that the world, the entire globe, is a family. India is a country where, beyond nature, we have a communication, a dialogue, with nature. We never struggle with nature. That is a part of Indian life. The reason is that with that philosophy, India has been moving forward. Each country and each nation is shaped by its civilization and its philosophical tradition. India’s ancient wisdom, as I have said, sees the world as one family. India is a country that not only speaks for itself but for worldwide justice, dignity, opportunity and prosperity. We have always spoken out in support of such issues.",IND_2014_04
IND,2014,"Owing to our ideology, we have a firm belief in multilateralism. Today, as I stand here, I am equally aware of the hopes and expectations that are pinned on the General Assembly. I am struck by the sacred belief that brought us together. We established the Organization on the basis of great principles and perspectives, in the belief that if our futures are connected, we will have to work together for peace and security, for human rights and for the economic development of all. We must work together to those ends. At that time, there were only 51 countries. Today, 193 sovereign flags fly in front of this building. Each new country enters on the basis of the same belief and expectation.",IND_2014_05
IND,2014,"In the past six decades, we have been able to achieve a great deal. We have ended many wars. We have established and maintained peace. We have assisted economic development in many places. We have helped to build a future for poor children. We have contributed towards the elimination of starvation and strived to save our planet. The 69 United Nations peacekeeping missions have made the Blue Helmet a symbol of peace in the world.",IND_2014_06
IND,2014,"Today, there is a surge of democracy across the world. The peaceful democratic transformation in Afghanistan shows that the Afghan people’s aspiration for peace will definitely triumph over violence. We have seen Nepal emerge from war towards peace and democracy. Bhutan’s young democracy is flourishing.",IND_2014_07
IND,2014,"There are also efforts towards democracy in West Asia and North Africa. Tunisia’s success shows that such a path of democracy is possible. In Africa, there is a new momentum for stability, peace and progress, and a new awareness is on the horizon.",IND_2014_08

IND,2014,"I have the same policy towards Pakistan. I want to hold serious bilateral talks with Pakistan in order to improve friendship and cooperation in a peaceful atmosphere, without the shadow of terrorism. I want to hold bilateral talks with that country. However, it is also Pakistan’s responsibility to come forward and to genuinely establish the appropriate atmosphere for bilateral talks. In raising that issue in this forum, I do not know how successful our efforts will be. Some people are doubtful.",IND_2014_12
IND,2014,"Today, we need to assist the victims of the floods in Kashmir. In India, we have organized large-scale assistance. We have not stopped at only India helping Kashmir. We have also asked Pakistan to assist, since that area was also affected by the floods. We have told Pakistan that just as we were helping the flood victims in India, we would also like to help those in Pakistan.",IND_2014_13

IND,2014,"Today, the world is witnessing a high level of tension and turmoil. There are no major wars, but tension and conflict abound. There is an absence of peace and uncertainty about the future. Even today, there is rampant poverty everywhere. The Asia-Pacific region, which is integrating, is still concerned about maritime security. That is fundamental to its future.",IND_2014_15

IND,2014,"Are we really making integrated efforts at the international level to fight against those powerful groups? I know that terrorism is a very serious problem for discussion. Even today, some countries are giving refuge to international terrorists, and they consider terrorism a tool of their policy. Good terrorism and bad terrorism — that is what we hear these days. At this time, there is a question mark regarding our struggle to fight against terrorism. The brutal return of terrorism in West Asia and its impact on countries far and near has elicited a concerted effort, which we welcome.",IND_2014_19
IND,2014,"However, the effort should involve all the countries of the region. If we want to overcome terrorism, then they must all contribute towards its eradication. We strongly emphasize this.",IND_2014_20
IND,2014,"Oceans, seas, space and cyberspace, besides contributing to our common wealth and prosperity, are becoming new theatres of conflict. In the same oceans that used to connect us, we are today hearing news of disputes. We once saw space as holding out potential for our achievements. Today, in cyberspace, which connects us in important areas, new dangers are being seen. International harmony and cooperation — on which the United Nations was founded — are needed now more than ever before. Today, we talk about an interdependent world, but have we become more united as nations? We need to think about that.",IND_2014_21
IND,2014,"Why, when we have a good forum like the United Nations, do we keep creating so many different groups?",IND_2014_22
IND,2014,"There is the Group of Four, the Group of Seven and the Group of 20 — and the numbers keep changing.",IND_2014_23
IND,2014,"Whether or not we really want to do so, we, including India, become members of them. Is it not the time to move on and leave behind those groups? When the United Nations celebrates its seventieth anniversary, how do we create a Group-of-All atmosphere? How can the General Assembly create an opportunity to solve all our problems? How can people begin to be more trustful? How can we become less competitive? We talk about unity, but then we divide the whole into different parts and pieces. Can we prevent ourselves from doing so?",IND_2014_24
IND,2014,"On the one hand, we say that our policies are interconnected; on the other, we think in terms of zero-sum gains. We think that if the other benefits, I stand to lose. Who receives the benefit and who suffers the loss? That is what we appear to be weighing. The pessimists are cynical. Like them, we are inclined to say nothing will change. It is easy to be cynical and to say nothing will change. But if we do that, we run the risk of shirking our responsibilities and putting our collective future in danger.",IND_2014_25
IND,2014,We must unite and prepare to meet the needs of our times. We must really work for global peace. No one country or group of countries can determine the course of the world or its policies. It is imperative to have genuine international participation and partnership. We should try to promote positive dialogue and cooperation among countries. Our efforts must begin at the United Nations.,IND_2014_26

IND,2014,Institutions that reflect the imperatives of the twentieth century will not be effective in the twenty-first century.,IND_2014_28
IND,2014,"They face the risk of irrelevance. I would like to emphasize that the policies and rules we made in the twentieth century may no longer be applicable. The speed of change is very fast. It is therefore essential that, in tune with the times, we adapt and reformulate, making the necessary changes and introducing new ideas. Only when we have done that will we be relevant.",IND_2014_29
IND,2014,"We should set aside all our differences and mount a concerted international effort to combat terrorism and extremism. Towards that end, we should adopt a comprehensive convention on international terrorism.",IND_2014_30
IND,2014,"That is something which is long overdue. It must be emphasized that our combined strength to fight against terrorism should be reflected in the convention. Our country, which has endured so many terrorist attacks, knows that, so long as the United Nations fails to take the initiative in that effort, and so long as we do not adopt a convention, we cannot be successful. In such work, we must not forget to make provision for peace, stability and order in outer space and cyberspace. We must work together to ensure that all countries observe international rules and norms.",IND_2014_31
IND,2014,"We must include the host countries and troop- contributing countries in our decision-making on United Nations peacekeeping. If they are included, their confidence will increase considerably. They are ready to make major sacrifices and to give their time and energy. But if they are excluded from decision-making, then how can United Nations peacekeeping become more vital and urgent? We need to seriously consider that. Today, let us redouble our efforts in pursuit of global disarmament. Let us also spare no effort to ensure that we work tirelessly towards those goals.",IND_2014_32
IND,2014,"Globalization has created new industries and sources of employment. At the same time, billions live in the shadow of poverty. A great many countries are suffering economic deprivation, barely keeping their heads above water. What seems so difficult today was never so difficult in the past. Technology has made many things possible. Reduction in the cost of technology has made it more widely available. If we think of the speed with which Facebook or Twitter have spread around the world and cell-phone use has proliferated, then we must also believe that development and empowerment can spread with the same speed.",IND_2014_33
IND,2014,"It is up to each country to make its own efforts at the national level. Each Government must fulfil its responsibilities. International participation is also very important. At one level, it requires better coordination of policy, so that our efforts become mutually supportive, not mutually damaging. It also means that, when we craft agreements on international trade, we accommodate one another’s concerns and interests.",IND_2014_34
IND,2014,"Let us think about the scale of the need. Today, basic sanitation is out of the reach of 2.5 billion people;",IND_2014_35
IND,2014,"1.3 billion have no access to electricity and 1.1 billion no access to drinking water. That makes it clear that more comprehensive and concerted international action is required. We cannot keep waiting for economic development. In India, the most important aspects of my development agenda are focused precisely on those very issues, which should also be at the core of the post- 2015 development agenda, as they deserve our utmost attention.",IND_2014_36

IND,2014,"We are very concerned indeed about issues relating to forests, wildlife, birds, rivers, water sources and the blue sky above.",IND_2014_38
IND,2014,"I would like to address three points. First, if we are to meet all of the challenges, we must fully uphold our responsibilities. The global community has agreed to work together on the basis of common but differentiated responsibility. That must continue to be the foundation of future action. That also means that developed countries must fulfil their commitments in terms of funding and technology transfer.",IND_2014_39
IND,2014,"Secondly, national action is imperative. Technology has made many things possible, such as renewable energy. We need imagination and commitment. India stands ready to share its technology and capabilities, as for example through the recently announced free access to a satellite.",IND_2014_40
IND,2014,"Thirdly, we need to change our lifestyles. Avoiding energy use is the cleanest option and would give a new direction to our economy. For us in India, respect for nature is fundamental and an integral part of spiritualism. It is part of our ideology.",IND_2014_41
IND,2014,"I would like to draw the Assembly’s attention to another idea. When we talk of climate change, we are also talking about holistic health care, connecting with nature and going back to basics. Today, I would like to underscore that yoga is an invaluable gift from our ancient tradition. Yoga embodies unity of mind and body, thought and action. It is important to coordinate all of those aspects. Such a holistic approach is valuable to our health and our well-being. Yoga is not just about exercise; it is a way to discover the sense of oneness with yourself, the world and nature. By changing our lifestyle and creating consciousness, it can also help us deal with climate change. Let us work towards adopting an international yoga day.",IND_2014_42
IND,2014,"Finally, we are at a historic moment. Every age is defined by its character and remembered for how it rose to meet its challenges. Today, we are responsible to rise and meet those challenges. Next year, the United Nations will be 70 years old. We should ask ourselves whether we should wait until we are 80 or 100 years old to take action. I believe that next year will provide an opportunity for the United Nations. After a voyage spanning 70 years, we shall be able to look back and review what we have achieved, whence we began, why we left certain places, what motivated us, how we proceeded and what we have attained. What are the challenges facing us in the twenty-first century? If we can keep all of that in mind, through exchanges of views, dialogue with universities, and intergenerational discussions with young people, who can contribute ideas, then we will find the ways to connect all of those things for future generations.",IND_2014_43
IND,2014,"That is why I say that arriving at the milestone of 70 years presents us with a great opportunity that we should not waste. By taking full advantage of this moment, we could achieve a new consciousness, a new life, with new ambitions and aspirations. We could give the journey of the United Nations a new form. I therefore feel that 70 years is a great opportunity for us. Let us come together and fulfil our promise to bring improvements to the Security Council. That issue has been before us for a long time, yet there has not been much progress. We need to think very seriously about it.",IND_2014_44
IND,2014,"In preparing and implementing the post-2015 development agenda, let us come together to keep our promises. For 2015, let us come together to give a new direction and make the moment memorable by giving the world a new lease on development. The year 2015 should be a banner year in history — a turning point in history. I hope that we will all live up to its promise.",IND_2014_45
IND,2015,"The United Nations is marking its seventieth anniversary this year, making this session of the General Assembly a historic one. I hope that this year will also be historic for the United Nations in terms of outcomes. I would like to assure the President that he will receive India’s full support in his efforts.",IND_2015_01
IND,2015,"Seventy years ago, the foundations of the United Nations were laid at the San Francisco Conference, in a city on the west coast of this country. India was one of the signatory countries of the Charter of the United Nations, although at that time we were not independent. We obtained our independence two years later. When the United Nations was established, a rather diminutive-looking man with the powerful weapon of non-violence was writing the final act in a struggle that would become a symbol of hope for the colonized and the oppressed everywhere. I am grateful that the United Nations has proclaimed the birthday of this extraordinary man as the International Day of Non-Violence. It is a pleasing coincidence that tomorrow is 2 October, and 42/55 15-29658 01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22 that we will be celebrating his birthday then. Mahatma Gandhi said, “The difference between what we do and what we are capable of doing would suffice to solve most of the world’s problems”. His message is most fitting in the context of the United Nations.",IND_2015_02
IND,2015,"The seventieth year of any human being’s life is a milestone from which to look back and reflect on what one has achieved and what one has lost. Similarly, for people associated with an institution, the seventieth year provides an opportunity to analyse whether the institution has fulfilled its purpose and achieved the goals set for it at its establishment. Today we need to ask ourselves whether we have fulfilled the purpose and achieved the goals for which the United Nations was established 70 years ago. When I ask myself that question, I receive an affirmative answer for some questions and a negative one for others. For example, the United Nations has been successful in preventing a third world war, assisting decolonization and dismantling apartheid. It has been successful in combating global epidemics, reducing global hunger and promoting democracy and human rights.",IND_2015_03
IND,2015,"Yet, when we ask ourselves whether we have been able to prevent conflicts taking place in various parts of the world, the answer is “no”. If we ask whether we were able to find permanent solutions to those conflicts, the answer is “no”. If we ask whether we were able to show the path of peace to a world which is treading the path of violence, the answer is “no”. According to those parameters, the United Nations appears to be ineffective at maintaining international peace and security, an institution that has failed to effectively address new challenges in that area.",IND_2015_04
IND,2015,"Today, the world is ravaged by war on three continents, with the Security Council powerless or unwilling to stem the f low of blood. Traditional solutions that rely on force have only exacerbated problems. We must ask ourselves if we have the political will to craft alternatives to conflict and to pursue them with commitment and single-minded dedication. Nowhere is such a goal more important than in peacekeeping. Under the blue flag, men and women are constantly working to prevent conflict, protect civilians and sustain peace processes. With 180,000 peacekeepers deployed so far, India has been the largest contributor to international security provided by the United Nations. Even today, about 8,000 Indian military and police personnel are participating in 10 peacekeeping missions, operating in highly challenging environments.",IND_2015_05
IND,2015,"India remains committed to continuing its support to United Nations peacekeeping operations and even to enhancing its contributions, as announced by our Prime Minister at the leaders summit on peacekeeping. Our new contributions will cover all aspects of peacekeeping: personnel, enablers and training. At the same time, no dilution of the cardinal principles of peacekeeping must occur. The fact that troop-contributing countries have no role in the formulation of mandates, which are often amended without consultation, is a matter of concern. That is a clear violation of Article 44 of the Charter of the United Nations. We also believe that peacekeeping operations cannot be a substitute for political solutions, a fact that the High-Level Independent Panel on Peace Operations underscored.",IND_2015_06
IND,2015,"As we mark the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations, I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the more than 3,300 peacekeepers, including 161 from India, who have made the ultimate sacrifice. We stand ready to contribute to the memorial wall for United Nations peacekeepers, which was approved by the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session.",IND_2015_07
IND,2015,"The safety of our peacekeepers, the security of our nations, and indeed the future of the international community itself now depend on how we respond to the greatest threat that we face today: terrorism. It is a threat that India has lived with for more than a quarter of a century, and one that was tragically brought home to this very city in the autumn of 2001. Since then, we have not adequately countered the proliferation of terrorist acts, the rise of extremist ideologies and the impunity of States that back terrorism.",IND_2015_08
IND,2015,"Only organized international action can defeat international terrorism. The world must demonstrate zero tolerance for terrorists who kill and maim innocent civilians and base its action on the principle of prosecute or extradite. The international community must make countries that provide financing to terrorists and safe havens for their training, arming and operations pay a heavy price.",IND_2015_09
IND,2015,"Equally important, the establishment of an international legal regime, under a comprehensive convention on international terrorism, can no longer be held up. Nineteen years ago, in 1996, India proposed such a regime at the United Nations, but the Member States have been unable to adopt it and have become mired in the issue of definition. We have to understand that no such distinction exists as good terrorists and bad terrorists, and that terrorism cannot be linked 15-29658 43/55 A/70/PV.22 01/10/2015 to any religion. A terrorist is a terrorist, and anyone who commits crimes against humanity cannot have a religion. Therefore, I appeal to everyone to come together during this seventieth anniversary year of the United Nations and to pledge to unanimously adopt a comprehensive convention on international terrorism.",IND_2015_10
IND,2015,"While on the subject of terrorism, I take this opportunity to share the challenges that we face in our ties with Pakistan. None of us can accept that terrorism is a legitimate instrument of statecraft. The world shared our outrage at the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, in which citizens of many nations were helplessly butchered. That the mastermind behind the attack is walking free is an affront to the entire international community. Not only have past assurances in this regard not been honoured, but new cross-border terrorist attacks have taken place recently, and two terrorists from across the border have been captured alive. We all know that these attacks are meant to destabilize India and legitimize Pakistan’s illegal occupation of parts of the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir and its claim to the rest of it.",IND_2015_11
IND,2015,"Let me use this occasion to spell out our approach clearly. India remains open to dialogue but finds talks and terrorism to be incompatible. Yesterday, the Prime Minister of Pakistan proposed what he termed a new four-point peace initiative. I would like to respond to this. We do not need four points. We need just one — give up terrorism and let us sit down and talk. This will solve all the problems. That was precisely what was discussed and decided by the two Prime Ministers in Ufa this July. Let us hold talks, at the level of national security advisers, on all issues connected to terrorism and arrange an early meeting of our Directors-General of Military Operations to address the situation on the border. If the response is serious and credible, India is prepared to address all outstanding issues through bilateral dialogue. Even as we counter the menace of terrorism, we must acknowledge that real social and economic progress remains a critical goal. The elimination of basic human want leads almost invariably to more peaceful societies, as is evidenced by a map of the conflicts that engulf parts of the world.",IND_2015_12
IND,2015,"Just a few days ago, we adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), with the Sustainable Development Goals at its core. They constitute a blueprint that is more comprehensive and holistic than the Millennium Development Goals. However, their successful implementation will require political resolve and an inclination to share both technology and financial resources, while simultaneously improving our delivery mechanisms. As a woman and an elected Member of Parliament, it has been my firm conviction that there is a shortcut to real social change, and that is empowering the girl child. Our Government’s policy and our Prime Minister’s programme of Educate the Girl Child to Empower Her was conceived with that vision.",IND_2015_13
IND,2015,"Our future rests on our building a sustainable planet for our children and our children’s children. As we prepare to meet in two months’ time, in Paris, the world expects us to deliver an ambitious and credible agreement on climate change. We have a duty to take common action, but in doing so we must keep in mind the larger historical contributions of some and the differentiated responsibilities of others. If Mahatma Gandhi were among us today, he would ask if we have used the resources of the planet for our needs or for our greed. He would also ask if adapting our lifestyle choices and reducing extravagant consumption would help us to correct our course. For this reason, the agreement in Paris needs to be comprehensive and equitable, while delivering concrete action. Developing countries can do more if they are enabled in their efforts by support from developed countries in the areas of finance, technology transfer and capacity- building. India is and always has been a willing partner in global efforts towards this goal. We will play our due role in reaching a meaningful, equitable and effective agreement in Paris.",IND_2015_14
IND,2015,"India’s reverence for the environment is based on our traditions, which have always held nature as sacred. The health of the planet is tied to our own well-being, and it is this holistic approach that guided us in our call for the First International Day of Yoga, which was celebrated with much fervour in 192 countries of the world, as well as in this hallowed institution. I thank the international community for its enthusiasm and support in this regard. I hope that the seed that has been planted will grow into a magnificent tree.",IND_2015_15
IND,2015,"I also congratulate States for their prompt action in tackling the threat of global epidemics. By linking our efforts, we have managed to eradicate smallpox and nearly eradicate polio. HIV/AIDS has been controlled and, more recently, the Ebola outbreak was contained, although not before an unacceptably high price in lives had been paid. The Ebola epidemic is an important example of how national action and international support can resolve a global crisis. We are proud that 44/55 15-29658 01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22 India played its due part in these efforts. Inspired by our successes, we must redouble our efforts to eradicate other diseases, whether it be tuberculosis or malaria.",IND_2015_16
IND,2015,"Natural disasters and man-made conflicts also deserve our coordinated response. In recent months, the international community has been found wanting in its response to the refugee crisis caused by the conflict situations in Syria, Iraq and Libya. What is needed is a swift response backed by political will. Our own response to humanitarian crises in our neighbourhood has been quick, responsive and holistic. Whether in Nepal or Yemen, India has emerged as a net security provider, assisting not only our nationals but those of other countries that sought our help. India will be hosting the first Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in November 2016, when the topic will be the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.",IND_2015_17
IND,2015,"Like the United Nations, India has walked a long way these past 70 years. As 1.25 billion of my countrymen would attest, we have done so happy in the knowledge that our democratic traditions are deeply embedded. Nonetheless, every once in a while, there is a need for transformative change — one that can reinvigorate the nation and redeem its spirit. Ever since the new Government of Prime Minister Modi took office a year and a half ago, we have committed ourselves to this renewal. It is one that has enabled India to play its rightful role in international affairs, while also becoming the fastest-growing major economy in the world. The driving force of this comprehensive renewal has been premised on the motto of sabka saath, sabka vikas, which places emphasis on the welfare of all our people.",IND_2015_18
IND,2015,"At the same time, we have started to reach out enthusiastically to all our partners in the international community. Our efforts have focused, first and foremost, on our immediate neighbourhood and the results have been truly transformational. We have also reached out to our extended neighbourhood, renewing ancient linkages and constructing modern economic partnerships, including, most recently, a summit with 14 Pacific island nations. Our Act East policy has replaced the previous one, Look East, with a more vigorous and proactive engagement in an economically vibrant region, and complements our Link West engagement.",IND_2015_19

IND,2015,"As with nations, so it is with institutions. Only periodic renewal can provide an organization with meaning and purpose. In a world that continues to be dominated by wealthy and influential nations, the United Nations notion of sovereign equality has permitted the developing world to question some unfair norms. But it has not permitted a fundamental challenge to the inequity of a system built for a world that longer exists. If we are to preserve the centrality and legitimacy of the United Nations as the custodian of global peace, security and development, the most urgent and pressing need is reform of the Security Council. This is the need of the hour. How can we have a Security Council in 2015 that still reflects the geopolitical architecture of 1945? How can we have a Security Council that still does not give Africa and Latin America seats as permanent members?",IND_2015_23
IND,2015,"We must include more developing nations in the decision-making structures of the Security Council. And we must change the way it does business by doing away with outdated and non-transparent working methods. Giving it more legitimacy and balance would restore its credibility and equip it to confront the challenges of our times. We are happy that during the past year, under the leadership of Their Excellences Mr. Sam Kutesa and Mr. Courtenay Rattray, we have achieved what we had been unable to do in two decades of discussions — a text for negotiations unanimously adopted by the General Assembly as decision 69/560. That first but critical step must be a springboard for action at this historic seventieth session.",IND_2015_24
IND,2015,"For an organization such as the United Nations, 70 years has a unique significance. It is an occasion for revitalization and for renewal. I invite everyone in this Hall to contemplate the idea of the United Nations as 15-29658 45/55 A/70/PV.22 01/10/2015 a banyan tree. In the eastern tradition, the banyan tree connotes wisdom, and yet is non-judgemental and all- encompassing. It has not one trunk but many, growing outwards, each connected to the others as well as to the sky and the earth. Its expansive branches provide shade and relief, and its base has always been a place for discussion and debate.",IND_2015_25

That could be the fate that awaits the United Nations. Either we can take this historic opportunity to renew this critical institution or we can condemn it to irrelevance and tragic withering. We could easily lose ourselves in a labyrinth of our own creation, but if we seize the day, we will see a United Nations growing to its full potential, a United Nations that can reduce the gap between what it does and what it is capable of doing, a mighty banyan tree providing the canopy for a peaceful and prosperous humankind.

This month we marked the fifteenth anniversary of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attack on this city. Tragically, less than 15 days ago, another attempt at killing innocents was made in an act of terror on this same city. We, who have suffered in Uri, Kashmir, recently, understand the pain inflicted by the same forces. The world has been battling this scourge for a very long time. However, despite the blood and tears of innocent victims, attacks this year alone in Kabul, Dhaka, Istanbul, Mogadishu, Brussels, Bangkok, Paris, Pathankot and Uri, as well as the daily barbaric tragedies in Syria and Iraq, remind us that these malevolent forces have yet to be defeated.",IND_2016_13
IND,2016,"We must acknowledge that terrorism is undoubtedly the greatest of all violations of human rights. We must accept this fact as a first principle. Terrorism targets the innocent and kills indiscriminately. Having gone far beyond affecting individuals or nations, it is a crime against humanity itself. But it is important to ask: who is behind this and who benefits from it? Terrorists do not own banks or weapons factories, so let us ask the question of who finances these terrorists, who arms them and who provides them sanctuary. Similar questions were asked by the Vice-President of Afghanistan from this rostrum a few days ago (see A/71/PV.11).",IND_2016_14
IND,2016,History proves that those who plant the seeds of extremist ideology reap a bitter harvest. The contagion of evil seen in small terrorist groups has grown into a hydra-headed monster backed by technological sophistication that threatens the peace and harmony of our world.

We need to forget our prejudices and join hands to draw up an effective strategy against terror. That is not an impossible task, provided that we have the will. We can do it, and we must do it; otherwise, future generations will forever hold us to account. And if any nation refuses to join the global strategy, then we must isolate it. That is my simple demand.",IND_2016_16

The brutality against the Baluch people represents the worst form of State oppression.",IND_2016_18
IND,2016,The Prime Minister of Pakistan also said that India had come up with preconditions for talks that he found unacceptable. What preconditions was he talking about? Did we impose any preconditions before extending an invitation to him to attend our Government’s oath- taking ceremony? Did we impose any preconditions when I went to Islamabad for the Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process and agreed to commence the comprehensive bilateral dialogue with Pakistan?

Bahadur Ali is a terrorist in our custody whose confession is proof of Pakistan’s complicity in cross-border terror. But when confronted with such evidence, Pakistan continues to deny it. Pakistan persists in the belief that such attacks will enable it to acquire the territory it covets. My firm advice to Pakistan is to abandon that dream.

The first pending task for the Assembly is the adoption of the comprehensive convention on international terrorism, which was proposed by India in 1996. In 2016, despite the fact that two decades have elapsed, we have yet to conclude an agreement. As a result, we are unable to develop a standard under which terrorists shall be prosecuted or extradited. I therefore appeal to the General Assembly that it act with fresh resolve and urgency to adopt that critical convention.",IND_2016_22

Just as we need a more contemporary approach to combating terrorism, we also need a less outdated Security Council, which currently reflects the world order of a bygone era. The vast majority of nations share the belief that the United Nations should not remain frozen in 1945, which serves only the interests of a few. Whether it is a question of institutions or issues, we must come to terms with present-day realities and the challenges we have before us. An expansion in the permanent and non-permanent Council categories of membership in order to reflect contemporary realities is therefore an urgent necessity.

For many compelling and terrible reasons, people are leaving the psychological, cultural and economic comfort of their homes to seek refuge on distant shores, giving rise to global anxiety. A large part of the world’s population still suffers from hunger and poverty. Young people are beginning to lose hope as they confront unemployment. Women, historically the victims of discrimination, are demanding what they should have — gender empowerment. The danger of nuclear proliferation is back in the headlines. Cybersecurity has become a source of deep insecurity.",IND_2017_03

We need a sense of urgency, as well as unshakable fortitude, if we are to take the decisions that can avert catastrophe. I am pleased that India has displayed the courage and leadership needed to take such tough decisions and launch its interlinked process of sustainable development.",IND_2017_04
IND,2017,"My Government’s most important priority is the complete eradication of poverty, and there are two ways of addressing that curse. The traditional method is through incremental levels of aid and hand-holding, but our Prime Minister Narendra Modi has chosen the more radical route, through economic empowerment. The poor are not helpless; we have merely denied them opportunity. We are eliminating poverty by investing in the poor. We are turning them from job-seekers into job-providers. All of our economic programmes have one main purpose — empowering the poor. Jan Dhan, Mudra, Ujjwala, Skill India, Digital India, Clean India, Start-Up India, Stand-Up India — describing them all would take more time than I have at my disposal. I shall therefore dwell only on three core programmes.",IND_2017_05
IND,2017,"The Jan Dhan plan must surely count as the world’s largest financial inclusion scheme. Those who had no money were able to open bank accounts with no balance. No other country in the world has enabled even those with no money to have a bank account and passbook. That impossibility has now become possible in India. At least 300 million Indians — almost the equivalent of the population of the United States — who had never crossed the threshold of a bank now have bank accounts. That was, understandably, not easy to complete in three years, but our banks have achieved that visionary goal set by our Prime Minister. While some have still to be included, the target has been set. Every Indian family will have a bank account.",IND_2017_06
IND,2017,"Mudra Yojana has enabled the Government to fund the unfunded. Today, through Mudra, people who had never dreamt that bank credit could be an option for them are getting soft loans without collateral to begin micro-businesses. I am particularly pleased to be able to say that 70 per cent of those loans have gone to women. Unemployment spreads despair. Through Skill India, Start-Up India and Stand-Up India, poor and middle-class youth are being trained to match their talents with bank credit and become self-employed as small-scale entrepreneurs.",IND_2017_07
IND,2017,"Ujjwala is one of the Government’s signature schemes. Poor women who had to work hard in the kitchen were sometimes left blinded by the smoke from their stoves. The poor are being provided with free gas cylinders so that women do not have to suffer the dangerous consequences of wood-fired kitchens. Uniquely, gender emancipation is at the creative core of that programme.",IND_2017_08
IND,2017,"Demonetization was a courageous decision to challenge the black money that disappeared from circulation and was one of the by-products of corruption. India has now also passed legislation for a goods and services tax under which there is one tax throughout the country, without the disorganized and punishing system of multiple taxes under different categories in different parts of the country. Our Save the Girl, Educate the Girl campaign is reducing gender inequality. Our Clean India programme is generating what can only be described as a revolutionary change in social attitudes and habits.",IND_2017_09
IND,2017,"At this point, I would like to note that nations with rising capabilities can generate these kinds of change, but the developed world must become an active partner in helping vulnerable countries that are still mired in stagnant poverty to reach the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) horizon by 2030.

IND,2017,"Regrettably, while we are fully engaged in fighting poverty, our neighbour Pakistan seems to be engaged only in fighting us. On Thursday, from this rostrum, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi wasted rather too much of his speech (see A/72/PV.14) complaining about us, accusing India of State-sponsored terrorism and violations of human rights. Those listening had only one comment to make — “Look who is talking.” The country that has been the world’s greatest exporter of havoc, death and inhumanity has become a champion of hypocrisy by preaching about humanity and human rights from this rostrum.",IND_2017_11
IND,2017,"Pakistan’s Prime Minister claimed that his nation’s founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, bequeathed a foreign policy based on peace and friendship. I would like to remind him that while it remains open to question whether Mr. Jinnah actually advocated such principles, what is beyond doubt is that from the moment India’s Prime Minister Modi took his oath of office, he has extended the hand of peace and friendship, and Pakistan’s Prime Minister must answer why his nation has spurned that offer. Prime Minister Abbasi recalled old decisions that have long been overtaken by events, but his memory conveniently failed him where it matters. He has forgotten that under the Simla Agreement and the Lahore Declaration, India and Pakistan resolved to settle all outstanding disputes and issues bilaterally. The reality is that Pakistan’s politicians remember everything but conveniently manipulate those memories. They are masters at forgetting facts that undermine their version of events.",IND_2017_12

I would like to remind him that on 9 December 2015, when I was in Islamabad for the Heart of Asia Ministerial Conference, a decision was made by his leader, Mian Nawaz Sharif, then still Prime Minister, to renew dialogue between us through what he called a comprehensive bilateral dialogue. The word “bilateral” was used consciously to remove any confusion or doubt about the fact that the proposed talks would be between our two nations and only our two nations, without any third party present. Mr. Abbasi must answer why that proposal withered, because Pakistan is responsible for aborting that peace process.",IND_2017_13

Have they ever thought about what the reason for that might be?",IND_2017_14
IND,2017,"There is only one reason for it. India has risen despite being the principal destination for Pakistan’s nefarious export of terrorism. There have been many Governments under many parties during the 70 years of Indian freedom, because India has maintained its democracy. Every Government has done its bit for India’s development. We have marched ahead consistently, without pause, creating integrated management systems, education and technology services and AIMS foundations in education, health, space and the entire range of human welfare. We have established scientific and technical institutions that are the pride of the world.",IND_2017_15

When we first began pointing to this menace, many of the world’s great Powers dismissed it as a law-and-order issue. Now they know better. The question is what we do about it. We must all look within ourselves and ask whether the action we are taking even approaches the level of our talk about it. In bilateral and multilateral discussions we all condemn this evil and piously declare our determination to fight it. The truth is that these statements have become rituals. The fact is that when we are required to fight and destroy this enemy, the self-interest of some makes them duplicitous. That has been going on for years.",IND_2017_18

But I should also remind the Assembly that at the 2005 World Summit there was a consensus that reforming the Security Council as soon as possible was an essential element of our overall effort to reform the United Nations. Efforts to conduct text-based negotiations on reforming and expanding the Security Council were initiated during last year’s session, and more than 160 nations expressed support for them. If we are serious, the least we can do is to produce one text that can be the basis for negotiation.

IND,2018,"Through the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana, the world’s largest financial inclusion scheme, more than 320 million Indians who had previously never seen the inside of a bank now have bank accounts.  The programme has enabled the poor to receive direct benefit transfers from the Government’s welfare programmes into their personal accounts, thereby stopping waste and corruption within the system. Similarly, Ayushman Bharat Yojana, the world’s largest health insurance programme, was launched by Prime Minister Modi a few days ago, on 23 September. That revolutionary scheme will benefit 500 million Indians, who will receive insurance coverage of 500,000 rupees per family annually. We have a prayer in India — Sarve Santu Niramaya — which means “May all be free from illness”. The Ayushman Bharat Yojana, or National Health Protection Scheme, is the answer to that prayer.",IND_2018_05
IND,2018,"Similarly, we have launched the largest-scale housing programme in the world aimed at ensuring that everyone  has a  roof  over  their head.  Under  the programme, we have set for ourselves a target of  nearly 21  million homes by  2022. So  far, more than  5 million homes for the poor have already been built. Two extremely effective programmes have also been initiated to increase the skill levels of those waiting to be employed through the National Skill Development Corporation and the Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency (MUDRA) programme, which seeks to turn the poor into entrepreneurs. I stress that more than 140 million Indians have taken out MUDRA loans. The most significant aspect of the MUDRA scheme is the fact that 76 per cent of its beneficiaries are women. At the heart of Prime Minister Modi’s transformative vision is a radical idea, which is that uplifting any nation is best achieved through the comprehensive empowerment of women. All the programmes that I have just mentioned have the welfare of women at their core. Last year, I spoke about the Ujjwala programme (see A/72/PV.19), through which, I am happy to report, 50 million free liquid-gas connections have been provided so far.",IND_2018_06
IND,2018,"Another such initiative is the maternity benefit programme, in which women in India are provided with 26 weeks of paid leave to care for their newborns. As a woman, Madam President, you will understand better than most how vitally important that programme is for every mother. Some developed nations with huge economies do not provide more than six weeks’ paid leave, thereby leading to a continuing struggle for more time off. In India, we have implemented what women across the world need, namely, 26 weeks of paid maternity leave.",IND_2018_07

IND,2018,"The greatest challenges of our era are the existential threats of climate change and terrorism. Underdeveloped and developing nations are the most affected victims of climate change. They have neither the capacity nor the resources to meet that crisis. The countries that have exploited nature for their short-term needs cannot abdicate their responsibilities in that matter. If we wish to save the world from the adverse effects of climate change, the developed nations must lift up the deprived with financial and technical resources. The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities was reiterated in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Prime Minister Modi, together with the Prime Minister of France, launched the International Solar Alliance. Sixty-eight nations have become members of the Alliance so far. In March, India and France chaired the founding conference of the Alliance, in which 120 countries participated. I am pleased to inform the Assembly that Prime Minister Modi has been acknowledged as a champion in that area. He is also working towards realizing the principle of one sun, one grid, since he believes that, as there is only one sun, there should also be a single universal grid.  If that goal is achieved, we will be witness to a major revolution in the energy sector, which will represent a major milestone in combating all phenomena related to climate change.",IND_2018_09

We imagined that the advent of the twenty-first century would see an age of common good characterized by cooperation but, here in New York, the horrific tragedy of 11 September and, in Mumbai, the catastrophe of 26 November became nightmares that shattered our dreams. The demon of terrorism now stalks the world at a faster pace in some places, and at a slower one in others, but it is life-threatening everywhere. In our case, terrorism is bred not in some faraway land but across our border to the west. Our neighbour’s expertise is not restricted to serving as a spawning ground for terrorism; our neighbour is also an expert in trying to mask malevolence with verbal duplicity. The most startling evidence of that duplicity was the fact that Osama Bin Laden, the architect and ideologue  of  11  September,  was  given  safe  haven in Pakistan.",IND_2018_10
IND,2018,"America  had  declared  Osama  Bin   Laden   to be its most dangerous enemy and had launched an exhaustive, worldwide search to bring him to justice. What America could perhaps not comprehend was that Osama would find sanctuary in a country that claimed to be America’s friend and ally, namely, Pakistan. Eventually, America’s intelligence services discovered the truth of that hypocrisy, and its special forces delivered justice. But Pakistan continued to behave as if nothing had happened. Pakistan’s commitment to terrorism as an instrument of official policy has not abated one bit, nor has its practice of hypocrisy. The killers of 11 September met their fate but the mastermind of 26 November, Hafiz Saeed, continues to roam the streets of Pakistan with impunity. What is heartening is that the world is no longer ready to believe Islamabad. The Financial Action Task Force, for instance, has put Pakistan on notice with regard to the funding of terror.",IND_2018_11

We believe that talks are the only rational means by which to settle even the most complex disputes. Accordingly, talks with Pakistan have been initiated many times. When they failed, it was only because of Pakistan’s behaviour. There have been many Governments of numerous parties in India. Every Government has tried the peace option. By inviting the Heads of State of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation to his swearing-in ceremony, Prime Minister Modi began his attempt for dialogue on his very first day in office. On 9 December 2016, I personally went to Islamabad and proposed a comprehensive bilateral dialogue. But soon afterwards, on 2 January, Pakistan-sponsored terrorists attacked our air force base in Pathankot. It is clear that we could not pursue talks in the middle of terrorist bloodshed. Even now, after the new Government in Pakistan came to power, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, wrote to Prime Minister Modi suggesting a meeting between our Foreign Ministers in New York. We even accepted the proposal but, within hours of our acceptance, news came that terrorists had killed three of our security personnel. Does that indicate a desire for dialogue? Could such a dialogue ever take place?",IND_2018_12
IND,2018,"Time and again, Pakistan has accused India of human rights violations. Who is a greater transgressor of human rights than a terrorist? Those who take innocent lives in pursuit of war by other means are defenders of inhuman behaviour, not of human rights. Pakistan glorifies killers. It refuses to see the blood of innocent victims. It has become something of a habit for Pakistan to throw the dust of deceit and deception up against India in order to provide some thin cover for its own guilt.",IND_2018_13
IND,2018,"The United Nations has seen that before. Last year, using her right of reply, the representative of Pakistan displayed some photographs as proof of alleged human rights violations by India (see A/72/PV.22).

We need to bring them to accountability through international law. In 1996, India submitted a document with a draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism at the United Nations. That draft remains a draft today only because we cannot agree on a common language. On the one hand, we want to fight terrorism; on the other, we cannot define it.",IND_2018_15

If we do not act now, we will have to deal with that demon later on, when it sets fire to the entire world.

It is time to wonder whether we are wandering towards the fate of the League of Nations, which came to an end because it did not adopt the changes that were needed. It was unwilling to accept the need for reforms; we must not make that mistake. The United Nations must accept that it needs fundamental reform. Those reforms cannot be simply cosmetic; we need to change the institution’s head and heart in order to make both compatible with the contemporary reality.",IND_2018_17

India is a country that counts dozens of languages and hundreds of dialects, distinct ways of life and cuisines. That is the best example of a vibrant democracy.

As we saw in the case of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the South will be most affected, even if the immediate causes are well beyond its geographical location. It is imperative that global conversations recognize this deep unfairness. The inequity of vaccine distribution should not be replicated in other domains.",IND_2022_13

India is on the side of peace and will remain firmly there. We are on the side that respects the United Nations Charter and its founding principles. We are on the side that calls for dialogue and diplomacy as the only way out of conflict. We are on the side of those struggling to make ends meet, even as they stare at escalating costs of food, fuel and fertilizers. It is therefore in our collective interest to work constructively, both within the United Nations and outside it, to find an early resolution to this conflict.",IND_2022_14
IND,2022,"While global attention has been on Ukraine, India has also had to contend with other challenges, especially in its own neighbourhood.

We believe that in such times, the international community must rise above narrow national agendas.",IND_2022_15
IND,2022,"For its part, India is taking exceptional measures in exceptional times. We do so when we send 50,000 metric tons of wheat and multiple tranches of medicines and vaccines to Afghanistan; when we extend credits of $3.8 billion to Sri Lanka for fuel, essential commodities and trade settlement; when we supply 10,000 metric tons of food aid and vaccine shipments to Myanmar; when we fill the gap in humanitarian needs left unaddressed by political complexity. Whether it is disaster response or humanitarian assistance, India has stood strong, contributing particularly to those nearest to us.",IND_2022_16
IND,2022,"The world as we have known it is poised for transformational changes. It has been affected in recent times by a succession of shocks, each of them significant. The COVID-19 pandemic called into question the overcentralized nature of globalization and has led all of us to seek greater resilience in and reliability of supply chains. The repercussions of the ongoing Ukraine conflict have further heightened economic stresses, especially on food and energy. Climate events have added to the disruption that the world is already facing.",IND_2022_17
IND,2022,"As for the promise of technology, it has certainly multiplied our capabilities but also added to vulnerabilities.

IND,2022,"The United Nations responds to terrorism by sanctioning its perpetrators. Those who politicize the Security Council sanctions regime under resolution 1267 (1999), sometimes even to the extent of defending proclaimed terrorists, do so at their own peril. Believe me, they advance neither their own interests nor, indeed, their reputation. India has always espoused a cooperative, inclusive and consultative approach to international relations.",IND_2022_25
IND,2022,"We believe that multipolarity, rebalancing, fair globalization and reformed multilateralism cannot be kept in abeyance. The call for reformed multilateralism — with reforms of the Security Council at its core — enjoys considerable support among United Nations Members. It does so because of the widespread recognition that the current architecture is anachronistic and ineffective. It is also perceived as deeply unfair, denying entire continents and regions a voice in a forum that deliberates on their future.",IND_2022_26
IND,2022,"India is prepared to take up greater responsibilities. But it seeks, at the same time, to ensure that the injustice faced by the global South is decisively addressed.

IND,2023,"Let me begin by expressing our felicitations to you. Mr. Dennis Francis. President of the General Assembly, and our fullest support to the theme of the seventy-eighth general debate. “Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: Accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all”. This is an occasion to take stock of our achievements and challenges even while sharing our aspirations and goals. And indeed, in regard to both, there is much that India has to share.",IND_2023_01
IND,2023,"The world is witnessing an exceptional period of turmoil. As it is. structural inequities and uneven development have imposed burdens on the global South. But the stresses have been aggravated by the impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and the repercussions of ongoing conflicts, tensions and disputes. As a result, the socioeconomic gains of recent years have been rolled back, resources for sustainable development are severely challenged and many countries are really struggling to make ends meet. Navigating the future appears even more daunting.",IND_2023_02
IND,2023,"At this juncture, it was with a sense of exceptional responsibility that India took up the presidency of the Group of 20 (G20). Our vision of “One Earth. One Family. One Future” sought to focus on the key concerns of the many, not just the narrow interests of a few. In the words of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, it was to bridge divides, dismantle barriers and sow the seeds of collaboration that nourish a world where unity prevails over discord and where shared destiny eclipses isolation. The New Delhi G20 Leaders’ Declaration articulates our collective ability to do so. At a time when East-West polarization is so sharp and North-South divide so deep, the New Delhi Summit also affirms that diplomacy and dialogue are the only effective solutions. The international order is diverse and we must cater to divergences, if not differences. The days when a few nations set the agenda and expected others to fall in line are over.",IND_2023_03
IND,2023,"As the United Nations itself symbolizes, finding common ground is an imperative. To listen to others and to respect their viewpoints is not weakness; it is the basics of cooperation. Only then can collective efforts on global issues be successful. Recognizing that growth and development must focus on the most vulnerable, we began the G20 presidency by convening the Voice of Global South Summit. That enabled us to hear directly from 125 nations and to place their concerns on the G20 agenda. As a consequence, the issues that deserve global attention got a fair hearing. More than that, the deliberations produced outcomes that have great significance for the international community.",IND_2023_04
IND,2023,"It was also noteworthy, that at India’s initiative, the African Union was admitted as a permanent member of the G20. By doing so. we gave voice to an entire continent that has long been denied its due. That significant step in reform should inspire the United Nations, a much older organization, to also make the Security Council contemporary. Broad representation is. after all. a prerequisite for both effectiveness and credibility.",IND_2023_05
IND,2023,"The outcomes of the New Delhi G20 Summit will surely resonate for years ahead. Among them is the Action Plan for Sustainable Development Goals, a crucial need of the day. Equally important are the High-Level Principles on Lifestyles for Sustainable Development and the Green Development Pact, as they shape our approach to our planet’s future. The transformative role of digital public infrastructure has also been finally recognized, as has the salience of women-led development in building an inclusive and progressive society. The reform of the international financial institutions has been given due weight, as has the resolution of debt vulnerabilities.",IND_2023_06
IND,2023,"The New Delhi G20 outcomes are expressed both as larger policies and as specific initiatives. They could be about building cities for tomorrow or fighting corruption; eliminating hunger or delivering quality education; ending plastic pollution or preserving the ocean-based economy; or for that matter, enhancing food security or even mapping global skills. Some address long-standing issues like the gender divide and climate action. Others focus on new concerns, such as the responsible harnessing of artificial intelligence. All in all. we have placed for the world’s consideration a set of actionable propositions, constructive solutions and new directions.",IND_2023_07
IND,2023,"Even as we encourage collective endeavours. India seeks to promote cooperation with diverse partners. From the era of non-alignment, we have now evolved to that of vishwa mitra — a friend to the world. That is reflected in our ability and willingness to engage with a broad range of nations and. where necessary, to harmonize interests. It is visible in the rapid growth of the Quad, a mechanism so relevant to the Indo-Pacific. It is equally apparent in the expansion of the BRICS grouping of the independent-minded nations Brazil. Russia. India. China, and South Africa, or in fact, the emergence of the I2U2 combination. Recently, we hosted the creation of the India-Middle East- Europe Economic Corridor. The forging of the Global Biofuels Alliance was another notable development. That willingness to work in an open-minded manner on specific domains is a defining characteristic of the emerging multipolar order.",IND_2023_08
IND,2023,"All countries pursue their national interests. We in India have never seen that as being in contradiction with the global good. When we aspire to be a leading Power, it is not for self-aggrandizement but to take on greater responsibility and make more contributions. The goals we have set for ourselves will make us different from all those whose rise preceded ours. India demonstrated that during the COVID-19 pandemic through the Vaccine Maitri initiative. Our endeavours, like the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, have gathered wide support. Our espousing of the International Year of Millets is enhancing global food security today. We have built development partnerships with 78 nations across geographies. We have also been first responder in disaster emergency situations. The people of Türkiye saw that in February, as did those in Syria.",IND_2023_09
IND,2023,"Our commitment is understandably even greater closer to home. When Sri Lanka experienced a severe economic crisis, it was India that first stepped forward. But even in distant regions, partners such as the Pacific islands have appreciated our contributions to meeting their needs in health, technology and climate action. The most populous nation and the fifth largest economy knows that its progress makes a real difference to the world, especially when so many nations identify with us for reasons of history, geography and culture. They follow our experiences closely and evaluate our solutions for their larger relevance.",IND_2023_10
IND,2023,"Last week, the United Nations assessed progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The mood here reflected the struggle to overcome challenges, especially those of resource paucity. It is therefore vital at this midway that we expand our capacities and regain our confidence. As the largest contributor to meeting the SDG targets. India’s achievements should give heart to others on this journey. After all. the global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) records that we have halved the global MPI value in the past 15 years, lifting 415 million people out of poverty. That progress has now moved on to a higher level, with ambitious socioeconomic initiatives covering financial inclusion, food and nutrition, health and water supply, as well as energy and housing. We are seeking to demonstrate that social welfare need not be the sole prerogative of the developed world.",IND_2023_11
IND,2023,"Programmes under way in India highlight the transformational role of the digital delivery of public goods. It has facilitated scaling up. enhanced efficiency and combated corruption. The national objective of leaving no one behind is forging ahead in so many dimensions. Moreover, the democratization of technology has opened mindsets, instilled confidence and inspired innovations.",IND_2023_12
IND,2023,"In our deliberations, we often advocate the promotion of a rules-based order. From time to time, respect for the Charter of the United Nations is also invoked. But for all the talk, it is still a few nations that shape the agenda and seek to define the norms. That cannot go on indefinitely, nor will it go unchallenged. A fair, equitable and democratic order will surely emerge once we all put our minds to it. And for a start, that means ensuring that rule-makers do not subjugate rule-takers. After all. rules will work only when they apply equally to all.",IND_2023_13
IND,2023,"We must never again allow an injustice like vaccine apartheid to recur. Climate action, too. cannot continue to witness an evasion of historical responsibilities. The power of markets should not be utilized to steer food and energy from the needy to the wealthy, nor must we countenance that political convenience determines responses to terrorism, extremism and violence. Similarly, respect for territorial integrity and non-interference in internal affairs cannot be exercises in cherry-picking. When reality departs from rhetoric, we must have the courage to call it out. Without genuine solidarity, there can never be real trust. That is very much the sentiment of the global South.",IND_2023_14
IND,2023,"Next year, the United Nations will be hosting the Summit of the Future. That should serve as a serious opportunity to drive change, champion fairness and reform multilateralism, including the expansion of the Security Council memberships.

IND,2023,"India has entered the Amrit Kaal, a quarter-century where greater progress and transformation await us. We are confident that our talent and creativity, now so visibly unleashed, will power us forward. The world saw a glimpse of what is to come when our Chandrayaan-3 landed on the moon. Today our message to the world is in digitally enabled governance and delivery, in the widening ambit of amenities and services, in rapidly growing infrastructure, and in our energetic start-up culture. It is visible, too. in vibrant cultural expressions, such as in the arts. yoga, wellness and lifestyle. Our latest assertion is in a pathbreaking legislation to reserve one-third of the seats for women in our legislatures.",IND_2023_16

RUS,2009,"Today, speaking from this high rostrum, I would like to highlight five topics that are, in my view, important to all of us and our common approaches to the international agenda.",RUS_2009_01
RUS,2009,"The first is the timing of this meeting and the moment that humankind is currently experiencing. This session of the General Assembly is taking place at a very critical and complex time. It can be said without exaggeration that we are living through one of the watershed moments of modern history. Besides the economic crisis — the first large-scale crisis of the era of globalization — global development as a whole continues to be threatened by regional and local conflicts, terrorism, cross-border crime, food shortages and climate change. The impact of the crisis continues to be felt by most countries of the world. Although so far we have been able, it seems, to avoid the very worst scenarios, the question remains: how to overcome the huge imbalances and deficits — amounting to trillions of dollars — accumulated in the global and national economies.",RUS_2009_02
RUS,2009,"Our collective agenda for unification has been dictated by life itself, which also dictates the growing need for the United Nations as a time-tested mechanism for harmonizing the interests of different States and peoples. As never before, we are feeling the need for informal collective leadership and for an increased role for such platforms as the G-8 and the more recent G-20, as well as other negotiation and mediation forums, and all the more because these operate not on a model of opposition, but rather to advance the converging interests of their participants.",RUS_2009_03
RUS,2009,"At this morning’s meeting, the President of the United States addressed this Assembly, and I would like to endorse one of the thoughts he voiced. He stated that no single country can or should attempt to dominate others, and that is absolutely true. However, these agreed approaches need to be implemented in some way, including through the United Nations system.",RUS_2009_04
RUS,2009,"Another distinctive feature of modern times is the increasing role of regional entities, which are growing more active on every continent. This trend is entirely consistent with the principles of the United Nations.",RUS_2009_05
RUS,2009,"Russia, for its part — together with its partners in the Commonwealth of Independent States, in the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and with its fellow BRIC countries Brazil, India and China — will continue to bolster the mechanisms of regional interaction. These mechanisms facilitate a collective response to common threats, while mitigating the consequences of the crisis for our citizens and increasing the sustainability of our national economies.",RUS_2009_06
RUS,2009,"Secondly, I want to touch on the issue of existing problems. Allow me to dwell on those that cannot be effectively addressed without the participation or outside the framework of the United Nations. The first task in this regard is to address the imbalance of existing mechanisms of global economic governance, the inadequacy of their rules of the game, and the chasm between the financial markets and the real economy. We need to make joint efforts to establish financial and economic models that will protect all of us from such turmoil in the future.",RUS_2009_07
RUS,2009,"Virtually all countries have seen a drop in output and in the standards of living of millions of their 17 09-52228 citizens. The crisis has exacerbated social problems, painfully tested young people at the very start of their lives, and caused significant growth in unemployment in all countries. Russia is no exception in this.",RUS_2009_08
RUS,2009,A painful blow has been delivered to our plans to alleviate poverty. A real threat of disruption of the Millennium Development Goals has emerged. We must do our utmost to prevent such a development. Donor assistance to countries in need cannot be postponed until some other time. The tasks set out as a priority by the international community must absolutely be addressed. The arrangements adopted at the G-20 summits and the United Nations Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development must be implemented — and they must be implemented within the deadlines that we ourselves set.,RUS_2009_09
RUS,2009,"The second major task in this context is to address the issues of global energy security. Three years ago at the Saint Petersburg G-8 summit in Russia, the principles for a new legal framework for such cooperation were formulated. The goal is to harmonize the interests of all participants in the energy chain: suppliers, consumers and intermediaries or transiters. It was not so long ago that we solidified these principles, and we invite all States to engage in discussion on them. We believe that such discussions should be conducted with the active involvement of specialized multilateral institutions, including, of course, the agencies of the United Nations family.",RUS_2009_10
RUS,2009,"The third task that Russia deems to be potentially critical is the comprehensive strengthening of the United Nations itself. The United Nations must adapt itself in a rational way to the new global realities. It should strengthen its influence while preserving its multinational nature and the integrity of the Charter’s key provisions. The most important component of the revitalization of the United Nations is reform of the Security Council. The time has come to speed up the search for a compromise formula for the Security Council’s expansion, and of course to increase its efficiency.",RUS_2009_11
RUS,2009,"The third issue I want to touch on is disarmament. The process of multilateral disarmament under United Nations auspices is an extremely important task. There are grounds for hope since, as members are aware, a number of positive trends have emerged in overcoming the protracted crisis. The Conference on Disarmament in Geneva has adopted its programme of work. I should also like to mention the Russian-Chinese initiative to develop a treaty to prevent the deployment of weapons in outer space, as well as our current proposal to universalize the Russian-American Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-range and Shorter-range Missiles.",RUS_2009_12
RUS,2009,"Russia will unswervingly follow the path of verifiable and irreversible reductions in nuclear weapons as an essential element of a new start in our relations with the United States. In Moscow in July this year, President Obama and I not only signed a relevant document, but also agreed on a mandate for further negotiations to elaborate a new, legally binding treaty.",RUS_2009_13
RUS,2009,"This treaty should replace the Treaty on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, which expires in December.",RUS_2009_14
RUS,2009,"Of special importance here is the relationship between strategic offensive and defensive arms. In my meeting with President Obama this morning, we discussed the recently announced adjustments to the United States’ planned development of a missile defence system. I should like to state in this highest of forums that we view this decision as a constructive step in the right direction, which has deservedly received numerous expressions of support from the international community. Russia is ready to engage in detailed discussions with the American side and to undertake relevant initiatives in this field in order to reach mutually acceptable agreement.",RUS_2009_15
RUS,2009,"Without resolving such problems as missile defence and non-nuclear strategic offensive arms, it will be simply impossible to achieve real progress in the field of nuclear disarmament. I believe that the work on this new treaty will be fully consistent with relevant provisions of the joint document endorsed by the President of the United States and myself at our meeting in Moscow.",RUS_2009_16
RUS,2009,"We believe that other nuclear States should join the disarmament efforts of Russia and the United States. There is no need to wait for further progress in the Russian-American disarmament process. We can begin forthwith to elaborate acceptable and practical arrangements that take into account the differences in the size of potentials. In that respect, we could draw on international experience in the twentieth century, for example the 1921-1922 Washington Conference on naval armaments, where participants agreed on the 09-52228 18 maximum size of their fleets without insisting on parity in absolute terms. If we take the same approach today, based on the current status of nuclear arsenals, we could send the rest of the world a sure signal that the unaccounted numbers will be added to the equation of strategic stability.",RUS_2009_17
RUS,2009,"Pursuing nuclear disarmament, strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime and promoting the peaceful use of nuclear energy will be at the very heart of the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). We cherish the hope that it will be successful.",RUS_2009_18
RUS,2009,"The global nuclear security summit scheduled for April 2010 will provide a good opportunity for a more detailed discussion of these issues. We support that initiative. We have also agreed with the United States Administration on joint steps for further progress on such aspects of nuclear security as the prevention of nuclear terrorism, expanding access to the benefits of peaceful nuclear energy to all signatories implementing the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in good faith, and other decisions. We call for collective cooperation on these matters.",RUS_2009_19
RUS,2009,"In order to reach a common understanding on such important issues, we must engage all nations and influential international organizations in the aforementioned negotiation processes. The international community, it must be said, has at its disposal such tried and tested measures for enhancing regional and international security as nuclear-weapon-free zones. In particular, there is a very pressing need to establish a zone in the Middle East free of all types of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. This is a long-standing issue, with respect to which a resolution was adopted at the 1995 NPT Review Conference.",RUS_2009_20
RUS,2009,"Russia, as a member of the Quartet of international mediators on the Middle East settlement, has consistently supported efforts to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime in the Middle East.",RUS_2009_21
RUS,2009,Russia has made specific proposals within the framework of the NPT review process to seek mutually acceptable ways of implementing earlier decisions on this matter. All countries of the region need to take an active stance on this issue and demonstrate their willingness to achieve that end.,RUS_2009_22
RUS,2009,"We also need to accelerate work towards a mechanism to ensure peace and security in North-East Asia. Russia has made proposals in this regard to the participants in the Six-Party Talks. In the present circumstances, this task is more urgent than ever.",RUS_2009_23
RUS,2009,The fourth topic I wish to address is that of regional conflicts and regional security. We intend to continue to participate in the search for effective options for settling regional conflicts. We are convinced that the use of force can only exacerbate such situations. That was demonstrated by the reckless attempt by the Georgian authorities last year to resolve the problems in their relations with South Ossetia by military means.,RUS_2009_24
RUS,2009,"At that time, in August 2008, we came very close to a situation in which a local armed conflict had the potential to grow into a full-scale war. I am certain that this is clearly understood by everyone in this Hall today. In order to ensure that this should never recur, we need clear and effective mechanisms to implement the principle of the indivisibility of security. Without such a mechanism, we will not be able to move beyond the legacy of the past or overcome existing prejudices.",RUS_2009_25
RUS,2009,I wish to stress that irresponsible regimes should not have any opportunity whatsoever to foment disputes among other countries.,RUS_2009_26
RUS,2009,"The role and place of the modern nation in ensuring global security is a topic of the greatest relevance today. We have witnessed situations time and again in which problems emerging within the confines of an individual State have acquired a regional or even global character. The incompetence and, very often, ineffectiveness of national Government institutions can have consequences that are fraught with risks for several countries. The prevention of such an outcome is of course a very complex and sensitive issue, but one upon which we must deliberate together.",RUS_2009_27
RUS,2009,These issues were the focus of discussions at a recent conference held in Russia. The outcome was quite clear. What we require in the future is a smart foreign policy. The current global crisis is not limited to economics; it is also a crisis of ideas. It is the accumulation of a critical mass of outdated policies and development models.,RUS_2009_28
RUS,2009,"Having developed the initiative to sign a new European security treaty, Russia has proposed taking a fresh approach to this problem and, above all, abandoning outdated policies. We all hope that the cold war has been left behind, but the world has not become more secure. What we need today are modern solutions and clear legal frameworks for implementing existing 19 09-52228 political commitments. We do not need declarations, appeals or demagogues; what we need are clear legal frameworks, including to enshrine the principle under international law that one must not seek to ensure one’s own security at the expense of the security of others.",RUS_2009_29
RUS,2009,Our initiative concerns the Euro-Atlantic space.,RUS_2009_30
RUS,2009,"However, its key provision on the indivisibility of security is a universal principle that is applicable to all regions of the world and is fully consistent with the letter and spirit of the United Nations Charter. The principle of the indivisibility of security should be an integral part of current international law.",RUS_2009_31
RUS,2009,"Values are the last issue that I wish to mention from this rostrum. The protection of human rights and interests and the universal application of commonly recognized norms and principles in that area should be the basis for strengthening trust and stability in international relations. We are all united by values that are rooted in morality, religion, customs and traditions.",RUS_2009_32
RUS,2009,"I am talking about such fundamental concepts as the right to life, tolerance of dissent, responsibility towards one’s family, charity and compassion, which are the foundation both of daily life and of relations among States.",RUS_2009_33
RUS,2009,"However, unfortunately, it is the reality that the world is witnessing growing nationalism and numerous manifestations of religious intolerance and hatred. That is why we believe that establishing a high-level group on interfaith dialogue under the Director-General of UNESCO is extremely valuable. It is particularly relevant on the eve of 2010, which the United Nations has declared International Year for the Rapprochement of Cultures.",RUS_2009_34
RUS,2009,"To conclude, I cannot fail to mention, as I stand here, another topic that is very close to the heart of all citizens of our country and all peoples of the world.",RUS_2009_35
RUS,2009,"Next year, we are going to celebrate the sixty-fifth anniversary of the end of the Second World War.",RUS_2009_36
RUS,2009,Russia put forward a proposal to adopt a relevant General Assembly resolution and to hold a special session to commemorate all victims of that war in May next year. We cannot allow its horrible lessons to be forgotten.,RUS_2009_37
RUS,2009,"However, from time to time we see neo-fascist organizations raise their heads. Racial, national and ethnic crimes are being committed. Attempts are being made to whitewash Nazism, to deny the Holocaust and to review the decisions of the Nuremberg Tribunal. I am convinced that strong and joint resistance to manifestations of neo-Nazism and to attempts to revise the results of the Second World War enshrined in the United Nations Charter should remain a priority task of the Organization.",RUS_2009_38
RUS,2009,"The creation of the United Nations was one of the principal achievements of the international community in the twentieth century. This Organization and its fruitful activities have become a symbol of the twentieth century, and there is simply no alternative to these activities. We have no right to forget that the United Nations possesses unique international legitimacy, and we all must preserve and strengthen this shared wealth of the peoples of the world.",RUS_2009_39
RUS,2010,"The current, sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly has started with an unprecedented number of events covering the full range of the most topical international issues. It is encouraging that, in the light of the numerous challenges facing mankind, a positive unified platform for collective action has been taking shape, with the United Nations playing the central role. Having learned from the dramatic events of recent decades and having realized that attempts to cut the Gordian knot by force in violation of the Charter will only lead to deadlock, the international community has concluded that there is no alternative but to address political, economic and other problems through joint efforts based on international law. And the United Nations provides a universal platform to strengthen this positive trend in international relations.",RUS_2010_01
RUS,2010,"The Security Council is a key instrument of this Organization to maintain international peace and security. The high-level Security Council meeting held on 23 September (S/PV.6389) reaffirmed its members’ intention to enhance that body’s efficiency, not only through direct involvement in conflict settlement but also by creating prerequisites for the non-recurrence and prevention of crises. This proves that the comprehensive approach to ensuring international security is gaining ground, as it reflects modern realities and is based on the principles and provisions of the United Nations Charter.",RUS_2010_02
RUS,2010,"The United Nations faces unprecedented, serious and multifaceted tasks in the key area of peacekeeping.",RUS_2010_03

RUS,2010,"This year has been marked by progress in nuclear disarmament. The 2010 Treaty between the United States of America and the Russian Federation on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, signed by the Presidents of Russia and the United States in Prague, is a real contribution by our two countries to strengthening international security and strategic stability. It is also the result of positive changes in the relations between Russia and the United States that have placed Russian- American interaction in world affairs on a qualitatively new level.",RUS_2010_07
RUS,2010,"We hope that the strong impetus provided by Moscow and Washington to the nuclear disarmament process will be followed similarly by all nations, primarily by nuclear-weapon States.",RUS_2010_08
RUS,2010,"Pursuant to Russia’s policy towards strengthening the United Nations role in global security, disarmament and confidence-building, we intend to table three draft resolutions during the current General Assembly session: one on transparency and confidence-building measures in outer space activities, co-sponsored with China; a draft resolution on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security; and a Russia-United States co-sponsored draft resolution on bilateral strategic offensive arms reductions and the new framework for strategic relations. We call for their adoption by consensus.",RUS_2010_09
RUS,2010,"The universalization of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and its guaranteed strict implementation comprise the cornerstone of a strengthened international non-proliferation regime. In that context, the search must continue for an effective solution to the Iranian nuclear problem on the basis of NPT provisions and the norms of international Law. The Iranian side must ensure the requisite level of transparency and cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which is acting on behalf of the international community with the Security Council’s support.",RUS_2010_10
RUS,2010,Clarifying the outstanding questions about the Iranian nuclear programme would not only meet the goal of strengthening the non-proliferation regime but would also quite obviously promote the interests of Iran. Russia sees no reasonable alternative to a political and diplomatic settlement of the Iranian nuclear 31 10-55396 problem through constructive dialogue between Tehran and the six countries involved. The meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the six countries in New York helped to consolidate the shared intention to ensure the earliest resumption of such a dialogue. We will continue to do our utmost to achieve this goal.,RUS_2010_11
RUS,2010,"As far as the sanctions instrument is concerned, sanctions are not a goal in themselves. The objective of the sanctions regime established by the Security Council is to signal to Iran that it must fully cooperate with IAEA, and to give an impetus to the negotiating process. All members of the international community must show solidarity based on mutual responsibility.",RUS_2010_12
RUS,2010,"We strongly reject a situation in which unilateral decisions — including ex-territorial ones that undermine the very foundation of further joint efforts — are made with regard to sanctions in parallel to collective efforts by the United Nations Security Council. We must put an end to that practice, which runs counter to international law and has negative political effects.",RUS_2010_13
RUS,2010,"Even more obvious, the economic and financial trade blockade of Cuba, whose lifting the General Assembly has demanded for a number of years, is clearly an anachronism. The codification of the principle of equal and indivisible security is indispensable to productive international efforts in this field, which is the precise goal of President Medvedev’s initiative to conclude a treaty on European security. The proposal targets the complete transition of Euro-Atlantic policy from its old Cold War agenda to a new one, as well as a firm legal foundation for the principle of indivisible security for all in the Euro-Atlantic region proclaimed in the 1990s. We welcome the substantive dialogue on this important Russian initiative, which has started in various international forums.",RUS_2010_14
RUS,2010,"A comprehensive settlement in the Middle East would make a crucial contribution towards strengthened global stability. The parties must demonstrate political will and extend every effort to promote the success of the resumed direct Palestinian- Israeli talks. The results of the ministerial Quartet meeting of major international mediators held on 21 September demonstrated that appropriate support to the Israelis and Palestinians will continue, but the ultimate responsibility for a successful outcome rests with them.",RUS_2010_15
RUS,2010,"In this connection, the decision by the Israeli authorities to not extend the moratorium on Israeli settlement activities has raised serious concern. A way out of the current impasse should be found so as to ensure that negotiations continue. Our proposal to hold an international conference on the Middle East in Moscow is aimed at advancing the Middle East settlement. This proposal has gained the support of all interested parties and the United Nations Security Council. If the direct Palestinian-Israeli dialogue becomes stable, the preparations for the Moscow forum can get under way, which should also substantively examine the Syrian and Lebanese tracks, as well as the prospects for the multilateral aspects of the Middle East settlement.",RUS_2010_16
RUS,2010,"The development of a comprehensive strategy to address the interconnected problems of the Middle East is on the agenda. It is necessary to continue working towards an international conference in 2012 on the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery in the Middle East, pursuant to the decision of the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.",RUS_2010_17
RUS,2010,"Russia supports the international strategy for a comprehensive settlement and for post-conflict rehabilitation of Afghanistan adopted by the Kabul Conference, which envisages a stage-by-stage transfer of responsibility for the situation in that country to Afghan authorities, as effective governing structures are established in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.",RUS_2010_18
RUS,2010,"The future of Afghanistan must be determined by the Afghan people themselves. The international community must continue to provide its assistance, with an important role being played by the United Nations.",RUS_2010_19
RUS,2010,"Lasting stabilization in Afghanistan and throughout the region will be impossible without resolving the drug problem. The dimension of the danger posed by narcotics emanating from Afghanistan represents a clear threat to international peace and stability and requires more resolute actions throughout the entire chain of the production and proliferation of narcotics — from the destruction of drug crops to the suppression of precursor supplies, including drug traffickers on the sanction lists of the Security Council.",RUS_2010_20
RUS,2010,It is also necessary to move to a new level of international cooperation. Russia’s initiative to establish financial and counter-narcotics security belts 10-55396 32 along the perimeter of Afghan’s borders is consistent with those goals.,RUS_2010_21

RUS,2010,We should also give new impetus to the Darfur settlement process. At stake is the stability of conditions in the Sudan and throughout the vast African continent. We welcome the constructive attitude demonstrated by the Sudanese and other participants in the high-level meeting on the Sudan that was held here recently.,RUS_2010_24
RUS,2010,"In Somalia, the confrontation continues between the Transitional Federal Government, supported by the international community, and extremists and terrorist groups linked with Al-Qaida. The lack of a settlement on land is fuelling the problem of piracy off the coast of Somalia. A more resolute pursuit of the political process and stronger assistance to the peacekeeping operation of the African Union and further counter- piracy efforts, including the criminal prosecution of pirates, are priorities in international efforts on the Somali track, as reiterated during the recent mini-summit on Somalia, which Russia fully supports.",RUS_2010_25
RUS,2010,"The results of the Millennium Development Goals summit have reaffirmed the important role of the United Nations on development matters and must help mobilize political support and financial resources for the timely achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

RUS,2010,"It is obvious that most global problems, including the achievement of the MDGs, cannot be resolved without engaging innovations, advanced technologies and modernization solutions. The same is valid for such challenges as climate change, energy and food security and the fight against diseases.

The degradation of fundamental moral values leads to the degradation of society. The recent tragic events in Norway, riots in Great Britain, protests by young people in other countries, and calls to suppress Christian minorities in the Middle East and North Africa — all of those events are the result of a deterioration in moral and ethical values. There can be no freedom without responsibility and no democracy without self-restraint. There is a clear and urgent need to counter the threats posed by nationalism, ethnic and religious intolerance.

Those who oppose the implementation of the Geneva communiqué bear an onerous responsibility.

The militarization of the conflict continues, with calls for open intervention.",RUS_2012_05

We hope that Lakhdar Brahimi, Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the League of Arab States, will be able to bring his vast experience to bear on moving towards an agreement on such arrangements, with the support of the international community.

We should not allow irresponsible actions dictated by expedient interests to shatter the system of international law.

Their erosion would deprive the international community of an essential mechanism for developing joint approaches to the settlement of crisis situations.",RUS_2012_17
RUS,2012,"It is appropriate to mention the compulsory instruments at the disposal of the United Nations. Under the United Nations Charter the imposition of sanctions falls exclusively under the jurisdiction of the Security Council. Decisions must be made on a collegial basis, with the understanding that sanctions should not lead to isolation of the State targeted for sanctions, but rather encourage it to engage in a dialogue to remove questions that the Member States may have. It is essential that sanctions should be well-measured and that they not cause any suffering to the population. In the past the Security Council has discussed the issue of the humanitarian limits of sanctions, but somehow the discussions have faded away. We believe it is important to resume them.",RUS_2012_18
RUS,2012,"Another issue that needs to be discussed in the Security Council is the consequences of unilateral sanctions imposed by a State or a group of States sidestepping the United Nations to advance their political goals. We have no doubt that such sanctions, especially when they are applied extraterritorially, weaken the unity of the international community and undermine the effectiveness of its efforts. For many years, the commercial, economic and financial restrictions imposed by the United States on Cuba have remained an illustration of the negative impact of unilateral sanctions. Russia, together with the overwhelming majority of members of the international community, calls for the swift lifting of the blockade, which is a relic of the Cold War.",RUS_2012_19

Violations of international law should not be portrayed as some sort of creative development.",RUS_2012_21
RUS,2012,"All of this is related to the debate regarding the concept of the so-called responsibility to protect. Further discussion of this concept should be held on the basis of the approach agreed on at the 2005 World Summit, which reaffirmed the need to observe the principles of the Charter of the United Nations when responding to conflicts within States. The protection of civilians is an issue far too serious to be exploited to achieve political goals. The ambiguity of the so-called responsibility- to-protect concept can be better understood in light of initiatives formulated by Brazil and several other States to move towards consensus.",RUS_2012_22

Of similar concern are the even more assertive actions of those who, citing freedom of speech, condone the glorification of the Nazis and their accomplices and desecrate the memory of the victims of the Second World War and the victors of fascism. Such actions are incompatible with the obligations of States under the Charter of the United Nations.",RUS_2012_29

RUS,2014,Perhaps it makes sense to return to that subject and reproduce the then demand of the American Government on a universal scale. Why not adopt a General Assembly declaration about the inadmissibility of interference in the domestic affairs of sovereign States and non-recognition of coups d’état as a method of regime change? It is time to fully exclude from international interaction attempts at illegitimate pressure by some States against others.

Another important aspect of that work would be to launch a pragmatic, de-ideologized conversation on politico-military architecture in the Euro-Atlantic area, so that not only members of NATO and of the Collective Security Treaty Organization but all the countries of the region, including Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova and Georgia, would enjoy equal and indivisible security and not have to make a false choice of “either with us, or against us”. New dividing lines must not be allowed in Europe, especially because in the context of globalization they could become a watershed between the West and the rest of the world.",RUS_2014_25

Today there is no alternative to developing consensus on the rules of sustainable global governance in the new historical conditions, with full respect for the cultural and civilizational diversity of the world and the multiplicity of development models. To attain such a consensus on every issue will be difficult, perhaps tedious. But recognizing that in every State democracy is “the worst form of Government except for all the others” also took a long time, not until Churchill issued his verdict. It is time to recognize the inevitability of that axiom in international affairs, which currently suffer from a huge deficit of democracy. Of course, someone will have to break the age-old stereotypes, to abandon claims to eternal exceptionalism. But there is no other way.",RUS_2014_26

By the way, speaking of chemical weapons, I would like to obtain honest information on the state of Libya’s chemical arsenals. We understand that our NATO colleagues, having bombed the country in violation of Security Council resolutions, do not want to stir up the disorder they created. However, the problem of uncontrolled Libyan chemical arsenals is too serious to turn a blind eye to. We believe the Secretary-General must show his responsibility in that matter.",RUS_2014_28

An important stage in that fight was the unanimous adoption of a series of Security Council resolutions, including those on the issue of foreign terrorist fighters. On the other hand, attempts to act contrary to the Charter of our Organization do not contribute to the success of joint efforts. The fight against terrorists in Syria should be built on cooperation with the Syrian Government, which has clearly stated its willingness in that regard.

As they say, better late than never. This is not the first time that Russia is making a real contribution to the fight against ISIL and other terrorist groups in the region. We are delivering large-scale supplies of arms and military equipment to Iraq, Syria and other Middle Eastern and North African countries, and we will continue to support their efforts to suppress the terrorists.",RUS_2014_32

We propose to organize, under the auspices of the Security Council, an in-depth study of the threat of extremism and terrorism in all of their aspects throughout the Middle East and North African region. That integrated approach also presupposes that chronic conflicts should be considered, above all the Arab-Israeli conflict. The failure to settle the Palestinian issue over several decades remains, as is widely recognized, one of the main factors of instability in the region, and that helps extremists to recruit more and more new jihadists.",RUS_2014_33

In 1945, the countries that had defeated Nazism united their efforts to lay firm foundations for the post-war world order. I should point out here that the key decisions about the principles for guiding cooperation among States and the creation of the United Nations were made in our country, at the meeting in Yalta of the leaders of the coalition against Hitler. The Yalta system emerged out of genuine travail, paid for with tens of millions of lives and the two world wars that engulfed the world in the twentieth century. And in all fairness to it, it has helped humankind traverse the turbulent and sometimes dramatic events of the past seven decades and has spared the world major cataclysms.",RUS_2015_01
RUS,2015,"The United Nations is an Organization unique in its legitimacy, representativeness and universality. True, it has recently been much criticized for its perceived insufficient effectiveness and for decision-making on fundamental issues that can be stymied by insuperable differences, particularly among members of the Security Council. I would like to point out, however, that over the 70 years of the existence of the United Nations there have always been disagreements, and the right to the veto has always been exercised — by the United States, Great Britain, France, China, the Soviet Union and later Russia, alike. That is entirely natural for such a diverse and representative Organization. When the United Nations was established, there was no suggestion that unanimity would reign. Indeed, the essence of the Organization consists in seeking and reaching compromise. Its strength lies in taking account of different opinions and points of view. The decisions that are discussed in the United Nations are either adopted as resolutions or they are not. As the diplomats say, they either go through or do not go through. Any action on the part of any State that bypasses that procedure is illegitimate and runs counter to the Charter of the United Nations and in defiance of international law.",RUS_2015_02
RUS,2015,"We all know that a single dominating power centre emerged in the world after the end of the Cold War. Those who found themselves at the top of that pyramid were tempted to think that if they were so strong and exceptional, they knew better than anyone else what should be done. As a consequence, they thought, why should they bother with the United Nations, which instead of automatically sanctioning and legitimizing necessary decisions frequently just stands in the way or, as we say, gets underfoot? It has become commonplace to say that the Organization, as originally conceived, has become obsolete and that its historical mission has been accomplished.",RUS_2015_03
RUS,2015,"The world is changing, of course, and the United Nations must keep up with that natural transformation. Russia is ready to work on that, based on a broad consensus with all its partners, but we consider efforts to undermine the authority and legitimacy of the United Nations to be extremely dangerous. They could lead to the collapse of the entire architecture of international relations. Then we would indeed be left with no rules beyond might is right. That would be a world ruled by selfishness rather than collective effort; a world ever more dictatorial and less about equality, genuine democracy and freedom; a world where an ever-growing number of de facto protectorates and externally controlled territories would replace truly independent States.",RUS_2015_04
RUS,2015,"What, after all, is State sovereignty, about which some of our colleagues have already spoken? More than anything it is about freedom — the freedom of every person, people or State to choose their own destiny.

Every term of international law and international affairs should be clear and transparent and possess uniformly understood criteria.",RUS_2015_05
RUS,2015,"We are all different, and we should respect that. Nobody is obliged to conform once and for all to a single model of development that someone has deemed to be the only right one. We should all remember what we have learned from past experience. For example, we remember instances from the history of the Soviet Union. Attempts to export social experiments and to push for change in one country or another based on our own ideological positions often led to tragic consequences and to deterioration rather than progress.",RUS_2015_06
RUS,2015,"It seems, however, that no one learns from others’ mistakes. They just repeat them, and the export of revolutions, this time so-called democratic revolutions, continues. We have only to look at the situation in the Middle East and North Africa, which the speaker before me discussed. Certainly, the political and social problems of the region have been brewing for a long time, and people there naturally wanted change.",RUS_2015_07
RUS,2015,"But how has it actually turned out? Instead of reforming Government institutions, aggressive foreign interference has resulted in the abrupt destruction of the very fabric of life. Instead of the triumph of democracy and progress we got violence, poverty and social catastrophe. And human rights, including the right to life, are simply ignored. One cannot help wanting to ask those who created this situation if they at least realize now what they have done. But I am afraid the question would go unanswered, because policies based on complacency and a belief in one’s exceptionality and impunity are never abandoned.",RUS_2015_08
RUS,2015,"It is now obvious that the power vacuum that has appeared in a number of the countries of the Middle East and North Africa has led to the emergence of areas of anarchy that immediately began to fill with extremists and terrorists. Tens of thousands of militants are now fighting under the banners of the so-called Islamic State. They include former Iraqi servicemen who were thrown out into the street in the wake of the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Another supplier of recruits is Libya, whose statehood was destroyed as a result of a gross violation of Security Council resolution 1973 (2011). And now members of the so-called moderate Syrian opposition, supported by the West, are joining the radical ranks. First they arm and train them, and now they are defecting to the so-called Islamic State. Indeed, the Islamic State itself did not come from nowhere. It, too, was initially forged as a tool against undesirable secular regimes. Having established a foothold in Syria and Iraq, the Islamic State is actively expanding into other regions, with the aim of dominating the Islamic world, and not just there. It is clearly not limiting itself to those plans alone.",RUS_2015_09

In such circumstances, it is hypocritical and irresponsible to make loud declarations about the threat of international terrorism while turning a blind eye to the channels that are financing and supporting terrorists, including through the proceeds of drug trafficking and illicit trading in oil and arms, or to attempt to manipulate extremist groups and make them do one’s bidding in order to achieve one’s own political goals, in the hope of dealing with them — or, to put it more simply, liquidating them — later. What I have to say to those people is this: Sirs, while you are certainly dealing with cruel people, they are in no way stupid or primitive. They are just as smart as you, and you cannot yet tell who is using whom for his own ends. The recent information on the transfer of arms to the terrorists by that moderate opposition itself is the best proof of that.",RUS_2015_10
RUS,2015,"We believe that any attempt to flirt with terrorists, let alone arm them, is not just short-sighted; it is incendiary. It could result in a dramatic increase in the global terrorist threat and its critical spread to new regions, especially considering the fact that militants from many countries, including Europe, are passing through Islamic State training camps. Nor, unfortunately, I must admit frankly to my colleagues, is Russia an exception. We cannot allow such criminals, who have already smelled blood, to return home and continue their evil deeds there. We do not want that. And after all, would anyone want that?",RUS_2015_11
RUS,2015,"Russia has always been firm and consistent in opposing terrorism in all its forms. Today we are providing military and technical assistance to Iraq, Syria and other countries of the region that are fighting terrorist groups. We think it is an enormous mistake to refuse to cooperate with the Syrian authorities and the State armed forces, who are valiantly combating terrorism face to face. Finally, we should acknowledge that no one except President Al-Assad’s Government armed forces and the Kurdish militia is truly fighting the Islamic State and other terrorist organizations in Syria. We are aware of all the problems and contradictions in the region, but we must nonetheless be realistic.",RUS_2015_12
RUS,2015,"I feel obliged to point out that Russia’s honest and straightforward approach has recently been used as a pretext for accusing us of harbouring increasing ambitions — as if the people saying that have no ambitions at all themselves. But the real issue is not Russia’s ambitions but the fact that we can no longer tolerate the current state of affairs in the world. In reality, we are proposing that we should be guided by our shared values and interests rather than ambitions. We should unite our efforts to address, on the basis of international law, these new problems we face and create a genuinely broad international coalition against terrorism. Like the coalition against Hitler, it could unite all the diverse forces willing to resolutely resist those who, like the Nazis, sow evil and hatred of humankind.",RUS_2015_13

Not only is the Islamic State a direct threat to them, it also desecrates one of the world’s greatest religions with its bloody crimes. The militants’ ideologists make a mockery of Islam and pervert its true humanistic values. In that regard, I would also like to address Muslim spiritual leaders. Their authority and tutelage are vital at this moment. It is essential to prevent those whom militants try to recruit from making hasty decisions. And those who have been deceived and who by force of circumstance have ended up in the terrorists’ ranks must be helped to find a path back to normal life, lay down their arms and cease their fratricide.",RUS_2015_14

Naturally, any assistance to sovereign States can and must be offered rather than imposed, and only in accordance with the United Nations Charter. In other words, everything being done or to be done in this area in accordance with the norms of international law must be backed by our universal Organization, and anything contravening the Charter must be rejected.

In our view, that means creating a space of equal and indivisible security that is not for the select few, but for everyone. Yes, it is a complex, difficult and time-consuming task, but there are no alternatives to it. However, for some of our colleagues the Cold War bloc mindset and desire to assimilate new geopolitical areas are still paramount. They began by continuing to expand NATO — and one wonders why, with the Warsaw Pact bloc no longer in existence and the Soviet Union broken up. And yet NATO is not only still there; like its military infrastructure, it is still expanding. Then they offered post-Soviet countries a false choice — to be either with the West or the East. Sooner or later, that logic of confrontation was bound to turn into a serious geopolitical crisis, and that is what happened in Ukraine, where the people’s dissatisfaction with the authorities was exploited and a military coup provoked from outside. A civil war erupted as a result.",RUS_2015_18

Only recently, it seemed that in the economic sphere, where the objective laws of the market apply, we would learn to live without dividing lines and to act on the basis of transparent rules, jointly devised, including the principles of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which stand for freedom of trade and investment and open competition. Today, however, unilateral sanctions that circumvent the United Nations Charter have almost become the norm. They not only serve political aims, they act as a way of pushing competitors out of the market.",RUS_2015_20

A number of countries have chosen to create closed, exclusive economic associations, with negotiations conducted behind closed doors and in secret, undisclosed to their own citizens and business communities. Nor do they inform other countries and Governments whose interests may be affected. Perhaps they want all of us to be left with the fait accompli that the rules of the game have been changed in favour of a small group, and without the participation of the WTO. That could completely unbalance the trade system and lead to the disintegration of the global economic environment.

Russia believes in the huge potential of the United Nations to help us avoid a new global confrontation and engage in strategic cooperation.

There have been attempts to replace the key objectives of maintaining strategic stability in all its components with populist slogans of “nuclear zero”. We see a number of countries possessing nuclear arsenals not participating in the existing treaties. The fundamental Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is being put to a serious test. Its parties find it more difficult to speak a common language, especially in a situation when certain nuclear Powers torpedo any compromises regarding the start of the negotiations on the establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery in the Middle East.",RUS_2016_14

However, progress towards nuclear disarmament must be made in the context of the full consideration of a whole set of factors that affect strategic stability, including the impact of unilateral global missile defence systems, the development of strategic non-nuclear strike weapons, the threat of the placement of weapons in outer space, the inability to ensure the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, and the growing imbalance in conventional arms in Europe.",RUS_2016_15
RUS,2016,We note the growing support for our initiative to draft an international convention for the suppression of acts of chemical and biological terrorism. The start of serious negotiations on that issue and on the Russia-China draft treaty on the prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space would help break the impasse in the key body of the United Nations multilateral disarmament architecture: the Conference on Disarmament.

However, it is inadmissible to use that situation as a pretext for a massive militarization of North-East Asia and a deployment of another set of United States global missile-defence systems.

An overwhelming majority of Member States voted in favour of the resolution. The minority was chiefly represented by the very countries that, contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, are attempting to dominate world affairs and impose their own development models and values on other States and peoples, led by a one-sided logic that undermines international law.",RUS_2017_01

In the past quarter century, despite challenges, our country has taken on in good faith its share of the work of eliminating the legacy of the Cold War and has done much to strengthen trust and understanding in Europe, the Atlantic region and all over the world. However, that has not been reciprocated by our Western partners, intoxicated as they were by the illusion of the onset of the end of history, and who are still trying to adapt rudimentary institutions designed for an era of bloc-versus-bloc confrontation to today’s realities. NATO wants to recreate the climate of the Cold War and refuses to implement the principle it solemnly declared in the 1990s — equal and indivisible security throughout the region of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.",RUS_2017_03

It is that policy that lies at the root of the protracted conflict in Ukraine. Despite the efforts of the Normandy format and the Trilateral Contact Group, the authorities in Kyiv constantly come up with new ploys to interfere with the implementation of their commitments under the package of measures outlined in the Minsk agreements of 12 February 2015 and endorsed by the Security Council.",RUS_2017_04
RUS,2017,"But even in those circumstances, Russia has been focused on constructive effort and on finding mutually acceptable ways to implement the Minsk agreements. In response to concerns that have been expressed about the current security situation, President Putin has launched an initiative to establish a United Nations mission to protect the OSCE observers in the Donbas region, and a corresponding draft resolution has been introduced in the Security Council. We believe Russia’s proposal will help to facilitate a settlement of the internal crisis in Ukraine that resulted from the anti-constitutional coup led by ultra-radicals.

The decisions of the Nuremberg Tribunal were a warning against forgetting the lessons of the Second World War and the disastrous consequences of attempts to take control of the world’s destiny by trampling on the lawful interests of other nations and peoples. It is disgusting to use concerns about freedom of expression as a pretext for condoning radical movements that preach neo-Nazi ideology and support the glorification of Nazis and their associates.

We think this issue should be a priority for immediate attention from the General Assembly and UNESCO with a view to establishing a legal framework to prevent such actions, and Russia intends to submit proposals for it. The continuing indifference to the shameful issue of statelessness that persists in Europe is also unacceptable, as is the suppression of minority languages, which is a gross violation of Council of Europe conventions.",RUS_2017_07

Unfortunately, outright pressure is replacing diplomacy increasingly often in the arsenals of a number of Western countries. Imposing unilateral sanctions on top of those authorized by the Security Council is an illegitimate act that undermines the collective international effort. Today we have all been watching with alarm as the United States has imposed yet another set of restrictions — in fact, extraterritorial restrictions — on Iran, and threatening the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which has become a key factor in international and regional stability. The United States embargo on Cuba, which has gone on for more than half a century, is a demonstration of the uselessness of policies involving unilateral sanctions, and almost every Member State has been calling for it to be lifted for decades. It is time to listen to them.",RUS_2017_08

We firmly condemn Pyongyang’s adventurist nuclear- missile manoeuvres, which violate Security Council resolutions. But whipping up military hysteria is not only a blind alley, it is a deadly one. It goes without saying that all Security Council resolutions must be implemented but, along with sanctions, they all include provisions on the importance of resuming talks. We must stop blocking those provisions. There is no alternative to the political and diplomatic route, based on a dialogue among all interested parties, for addressing the Korean peninsula’s nuclear problem.

In any internal conflict, the international community must encourage the parties to take the path of national reconciliation and compromise. Efforts to ignore the opinions of others and resort to decrees and ultimatums, or to use force to circumvent the Charter of United Nations, have never done any good. The explosion of international terrorism, the millions of refugees and unprecedented waves of illegal migration are to a large degree the result of the attempts of the past few years to achieve regime change, including through the armed interventions that have wreaked havoc and destruction in the Middle East and North Africa and have paved the way for terrorists in parts of the world where they had never appeared before.",RUS_2017_10
RUS,2017,"Despite the fact that the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) is pulling back in Syria and Iraq, considerable additional effort will be needed to stabilize the region. We should recall that we are fighting Al-Nusra as well as ISIL, despite the fact that for some reason Al-Nusra is tolerated by United States coalition members. Recent developments in Syria have given grounds for cautious optimism. The sixth international meeting on Syria, held in Astana on 14 and 15 September, finalized the establishment of the four de-escalation zones, which had been agreed on with the participation of Russia, Iran, Turkey, the United States, Jordan and the United Nations, with the support of many other countries. The agreements create the conditions for further progress towards implementing Security Council resolution 2254 (2015) on the basis of direct dialogue between the Government and the opposition aimed at uniting their efforts to eliminate the terrorist epicentre as soon as possible and restoring peace and unity throughout the country, while resolving its acute humanitarian problems. The most urgent task is to increase the supplies of humanitarian aid and demining the liberated territories. We believe firmly that anyone who sincerely desires peace for Syria and its people should take part in this process under the leadership of the United Nations and without any preconditions. The incidents where chemical weapons have been used in the region are a separate issue.

In all of those situations, as with any conflict, Russia is pursuing a balanced policy and working with all parties without exception. With regard to issues in the Middle East and North Africa, we cannot put United Nations decisions on the Palestinian question and the Arab Peace Initiative on the backburner, much less consign them to oblivion. We believe that restoring Palestinian unity is crucial and welcome Egypt’s efforts in that direction. Russia is ready to assist in every possible way with the resumption of direct talks between Israel and Palestine, and to cooperate with its partners in the Quartet and the Arab League of States for that purpose. As long as the Palestinian question goes unresolved, it will continue to be exploited by extremists, who are attracting ever more new recruits.",RUS_2017_12

We welcome the reform of United Nations counter-terrorism activities that the Secretary-General has initiated, which the General Assembly has endorsed.

All of us, including those who are used to telling the world what to do, will have to adapt to it. It is in our common interests not to try to restrain this natural process. We will have to work to ensure that the world order becomes fair and democratic, 26/33 17-29585 just as the founding fathers of the United Nations envisioned.

The International Olympic Movement, and sports in general, should remain outside politics. First and foremost, we must foster in young people respect for the cultural and civilizational diversity of today’s world. We invite everybody to the nineteenth World Festival of Youth and Students, which my country will host in Sochi less than a month from now.

If we are to do that today, we badly need to revive the culture of diplomacy and dialogue and the quest for a balance of our interests, rather than making rash, instinctive decisions in our desire to punish those who disobey us.

On the other hand, we see the desire of a number of Western States to retain their self-proclaimed status as world leaders and slow the irreversible and objective process of establishing multipolarity.

Efforts are being made to draw some countries into military alliances that are designed to further specific agendas against the will of the peoples of those countries, while other States are threatened with punishment for their free choice of partners and allies.

The collective mechanisms for responding to common security challenges have stalled. Diplomacy and a culture of negotiation and compromise are increasingly replaced by dictates and unilateral extraterritorial restrictions effected without the consent of the Security Council.

We have already been through that, and we well remember how often spurious pretexts have been used to justify interventions and unleash wars, as was the case in Yugoslavia in 1999, Iraq in 2003 and Libya in 2011. The same methods are being used in Syria today. On 14 April, missile strikes were launched against Syria on a completely invented pretext, just hours before international inspectors were expected to arrive at the site of an incident that had been staged.

Russia’s energetic action, in response to the request of the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic and supported by diplomatic efforts in the context of the Astana process, helped prevent that devastating  scenario. The Syrian National Dialogue Congress, initiated by Russia, Iran and Turkey in Sochi in January, established the conditions for a political settlement in line with Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), and the basis for the intra-Syrian constitutional committee now being established in Geneva.

Against the backdrop of recent developments, it is becoming ever more urgent that under the auspices of the United Nations we should develop global rules for the responsible behaviour of States in cyberspace, including the principles of the non-use of force, non-interference in internal affairs and respect for State sovereignty. We intend to introduce a draft resolution to that effect in the First Committee. We also believe that it is important to start work on a convention on cybercrime, and we envisage holding the relevant discussions in the Third Committee.",RUS_2018_18

Together with us, our allies and partners in the Collective Security Treaty Organization, the Eurasian Economic Community, the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) group and an overwhelming majority of other countries are advocating for the democratization of all aspects of international affairs and in the interests of all States, without exception.

RUS,2019,"We are getting ever closer to the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, which was established thanks to victory in the Second World War and our recognition that a collective mechanism for maintaining international peace and security was essential. Unhappily, the events of the Cold War, which began soon after, prevented it from unleashing the full extent of its potential for good. The hope re-emerged almost 30 years ago with the fall of the Berlin Wall, the symbol of two irreconcilably opposed systems. It was the hope that perhaps at last we could turn the page on the pain of wars, cold and hot, and unite our efforts for the benefit of all humankind.",RUS_2019_01
RUS,2019,"However, we have to admit that despite the fact that thanks to the United Nations we have succeeded in preventing a third world war, there are no fewer conflicts and enmity on the Earth, and new and terrible challenges have emerged — international terrorism, drug trafficking, climate change, illegal migration and a growing gap between rich and poor. Coping with these and many other challenges becomes harder and harder every year, and the international community is only growing ever more fragmented. We believe that the chief reason for this state of affairs is the unwillingness of the countries that declared themselves the victors in the Cold War to consider the legitimate interests of every other State and to accept the objective realities of the course of history. The West is finding it difficult to come to terms with the fact that its centuries-long dominance of world affairs is disappearing. New centres of economic growth and political influence are springing up and becoming stronger, and without them it will be impossible to find sustainable solutions to the world’s problems, which we can address only through the firm foundation provided by the Charter of the United Nations and by balancing the interests of every State.",RUS_2019_02
RUS,2019,"The leading Western nations are trying to prevent the establishment of a polycentric world, restore their positions of privilege and impose standards of conduct on everyone else based on their own narrow interpretation of liberalism. To put it in a nutshell, they say, “We are liberals and can therefore do anything we want”. In its desire to achieve this, the West recalls international law ever more rarely, and ever more often and more insistently argues for a so-called rules-based order. The aim of the concept of this kind of order is obvious — it is to rewrite the norms of international law that no longer suit the West and replace them with rules that conform to their self-serving schemes, devised based on political expediency, while the West proclaims itself, and itself alone, the undisputed source of legitimacy. For instance, when it is advantageous, the right of peoples to self-determination is important, but when it is not, it is declared to be illegitimate.",RUS_2019_03
RUS,2019,"These revisionist rules are justified by manipulating the public consciousness, disseminating false information, creating double standards for human rights, suppressing unwelcome media outlets and banning journalism. The West also has apt pupils among its client States in post-Soviet territory. Collective work on an equal footing is being replaced by closed- format meetings held outside the legitimate multilateral frameworks, with approaches agreed on behind closed doors by a select few that are then declared to be multilateral agreements, accompanied by attempts to privatize the secretariats of international organizations and use them to advance non-consensus ideas in order to circumvent universal mechanisms.",RUS_2019_04
RUS,2019,"The attacks on international law are reaching alarming levels. There has been much talk about the withdrawal of the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action for Iran’s nuclear programme, endorsed by Security Council resolution 2231 (2015). Not only has Washington repudiated its obligations under the resolution, it has started demanding that everyone else also play by the United States’ rules and sabotage its implementation. The United States has taken a hard line in its efforts to erode United Nations resolutions on the international legal foundations for a settlement in the Middle East. It has proposed that we await some so-called deal of the century while at the same time it takes unilateral decisions on Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. The possibility of a two-State solution to the Palestinian issue, which is of key significance for satisfying the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people and ensuring the security of Israel and the whole region, is under threat.",RUS_2019_05

RUS,2019,"The hidden agendas continue in the counter-terrorism arena. Despite the universally binding Security Council resolutions on listing terrorist organizations, some countries have made it a rule to shield terrorists and even work with them on the ground, as we have seen in Afghanistan, Libya and Syria, for instance. The United States is already saying openly that Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham is a quite moderate group that it can do business with. It also wants to get other members of the Security Council to go along with its unacceptable reasoning, as the recent discussions on the situation in Idlib in Syria showed. And the West also applies its own rules with regard to the Balkans, where it is openly working to undermine Security Council resolutions on the settlements in Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina.",RUS_2019_07
RUS,2019,"Together with the resolutions of the Security Council, our universal conventions are integral to international law. The West would like to replace them with its rules, too, as happened with the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, whose Technical — and I stress the word “technical” — Secretariat was illegally granted so-called attributive functions as a result of unlawful manipulation and unscrupulous pressure, in direct violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and the exclusive prerogatives of the Security Council.",RUS_2019_08
RUS,2019,"The game-playing continues around conventions that require all countries to uphold the linguistic, educational, religious and other rights of their national minorities.

RUS,2019,"Revisionist tendencies with regard to international law are increasingly evident in the sustained attempts to rewrite the history of the Second World War and to justify the growing manifestations of neo-Nazism and the vandalism of monuments to the liberators of Europe and the victims of the Holocaust. The strength of key principles of the United Nations Charter such as non-interference in the internal affairs of others and the inadmissibility of the use or threat of force is also being tested. Attempts are now being made to add Venezuela to the list of countries whose statehood has been violated before our eyes through aggression or foreign-inspired coups. Like an overwhelming majority of the States Members of the United Nations, Russia rejects any attempt to resurrect the rules of the Monroe Doctrine era in Latin America and to effect regime change in sovereign States from outside without shrinking from military blackmail, unlawful coercion and blockades, as is the case with Cuba despite numerous United Nations resolutions.",RUS_2019_10

RUS,2019,"This November marks another anniversary —20 years since the Charter for European Security and the Platform for Cooperative Security were adopted at the sixth Summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Those documents set out the principles of cooperation for every country and regional organization in the Euro-Atlantic area. Our Heads of States and Governments solemnly declared that no country should pursue its own security at the expense of another. Today, regrettably, the consensus reached back then at the highest level is being replaced by the practices that NATO has adopted as its rules, as it continues to think in terms of seeking out enemies, moving its military infrastructure eastward towards Russia’s borders and increasing its military budgets, although they are already more than 20 times larger than those of Russia. We call for a return to the agreements that establish equal and indivisible security within the OSCE area, which some of Europe’s responsible politicians have spoken out in favour of recently, as was the case at the August meeting of President Putin of Russia and President Macron of France, for instance.",RUS_2019_12

RUS,2019,"Tremendous damage has been done to the decades- old system of global strategic stability by the actions of the United States, which, after withdrawing from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, has now destroyed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, with the obedient support of every member of NATO. Now the future of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) is in question. On top of that, the United States refuses to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear- Test-Ban Treaty and has lowered the threshold in its doctrinal documents for the use of nuclear weapons. It is also on a course to transform cyberspace and outer space into arenas for military confrontation.",RUS_2019_14
RUS,2019,"Russia has put forward a number of initiatives to prevent the further escalation of tensions. President Putin announced the decision to refrain from deploying land- based intermediate- and short-range missiles in Europe and other regions as long as the United States does the same. We have urged the United States and NATO to sign up to a moratorium in that regard. We have also repeatedly invited Washington to begin negotiations on extending the New START Treaty. Together with China, we support an agreement on a legally binding document on the prevention of an arms race in outer space. So far the reaction of the United States and its allies to all of these proposals has not been encouraging. We are also disturbed by the protracted lack of a response to a proposal we made to our American colleagues a year ago to adopt a high-level Russian-American declaration on the unacceptability and inadmissibility of nuclear war, a war that by definition no one can win. We call on all Member States to support that initiative.",RUS_2019_15

We support the consolidation of efforts to combat international terrorism under the auspices of the United Nations.

That all leads to the fragmentation of the global economic arena and has a negative impact on people’s lives. We believe that it is essential to return to working constructively together both in entities of the United Nations system and in the Group of 20.

We have already made progress in that direction by linking development plans for the Eurasian Economic Union and the Chinese Belt and Road initiative.

It is a kind of safety net, and if we respect the Charter, it will guarantee humankind’s peaceful development by finding a balance of what are sometimes the very contradictory interests of various countries. Perhaps the main conclusion to be drawn from those 75 years is that States’ experience of non-ideological cooperation in the face of a common threat, gained in the course of that cruellest of wars, is still relevant. Today’s challenges and threats are no less dangerous. Only by working together can we respond to them effectively.

RUS,2020,"The current changes certainly have an effect on the principal UN body, the Security Council, as well as on the debate concerning the approaches to its reform. Our logic is that the Security Council should be more inclusive of the interests of all countries, as well as the diversity of their positions, base its work on the principle of the broadest possible consensus among States and, at the same time, continue to serve as the cornerstone of global governance, which cannot be achieved unless the permanent members of the Security Council retain their veto power.",RUS_2020_06

The range of cross- border threats is also expanding. Numerous regional hotbeds of tension have a substantial destabilizing potential.

RUS,2021,"Naturally, no one can be opposed to rules as such. After all, that is exactly what the Charter of the United Nations is — a set of rules. Those rules, however, were approved by all the countries of the world. Similarly, any new norms governing international interaction must be agreed in universal forums, above all in this one. On the other hand, when rules are established behind closed doors, circumventing this universal Organization, they cannot be fully legitimate.",RUS_2021_05

Following the same logic, Germany and France recently announced the creation of the Alliance for Multilateralism; but what kind of structure could be more multilateral than the United Nations? Berlin and Paris, however, have decided that at the United Nations there are many conservatives that hinder the efforts of the vanguard.

RUS,2021,"There is a recent example: the United States Administration has come up with the idea of convening a Summit for Democracy. It goes without saying that Washington will choose the participants by itself, thereby hijacking the right to decide to what degree a country meets the standards of democracy. Essentially, that initiative is in the spirit of the Cold War, as it declares a new ideological crusade against all dissenters. It should be noted that the initiative is being implemented against the background of President Biden’s words that the United States does not seek a world divided into opposing blocs. The fact is that the Summit for Democracy will be a step towards dividing the global community into “us” and “them”.",RUS_2021_07
RUS,2021,"It is also telling that, while it declares the primacy of democracy in its relations with all its partners, Washington is concerned only with the domestic situation in relevant countries.

RUS,2021,"On the other hand, when the right to self- determination runs counter to the West’s geopolitical interests, as it did when the people of Crimea expressed their free will in the 2014 referendum on the peninsula’s reunification with Russia, the West forgets all about that right and introduces illegitimate sanctions against its exercise. The reason is simple — the Crimean people were trying to break free from the ultra-radicals who were behind the coup in Ukraine supported by the West. That means that since the good guys came to power in Kyiv, they are, according to the Western rules, to be protected and exonerated.",RUS_2021_12

RUS,2021,"A responsible approach is also needed in other spheres of strategic stability. After Washington’s withdrawal from the Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, Russia made a unilateral commitment not to deploy intermediate- or shorter- range conventional or nuclear missiles in regions where there are no similar United States-made weapons. We continue to await the response of NATO members to our proposal to proclaim a similar moratorium, reinforced — and I emphasize this — with mutual verification measures.",RUS_2021_21
RUS,2021,We also recognize the new challenge and threat of States that intend to militarize the Internet and unleash a cyberarms race.

Instead of honest dialogue and compromise, what we have is disinformation, coarse statements and provocations. The West’s policy is undermining trust in international institutions as bodies designed to reconcile different interests, and in international law as a guarantee of fairness and of the protection of the weak against arbitrary acts. We are witnessing negative trends in a concentrated fashion at the United Nations, which arose from the rubble of German fascism and Japanese militarism and was established to promote friendly relations and prevent conflicts among its members.",RUS_2022_01

The question is whether that world order will have a single hegemon that forces everyone else to live by its infamous rules, benefiting it alone, or whether we will have a democratic and fair world, free from blackmail and intimidation of anyone deemed undesirable, a world without neo-Nazism and neocolonialism. Russia is resolute in choosing the latter option, and together with our allies, partners and like-minded countries, we call for working to make it a reality. The unipolar model of global development serving the interests of the one per cent, who for centuries fuelled its excessive consumption at the expense of the resources of Asia, Africa and Latin America, is receding into the past. Today, with the emergence of sovereign States that are ready to defend their national interests, an equal, socially oriented and sustainable multipolar architecture is taking shape. However, Washington, and the Western ruling elites that have fully submitted to its rule, view those objective geopolitical processes as a threat to their dominance.",RUS_2022_02
RUS,2022,"The United States and its allies want to stop the march of history. Having at some point declared victory in the Cold War, Washington elevated itself almost to the level of God’s messenger on Earth, free of constraints and with a sacred right to act with impunity wherever and however it wants. Any State could be declared its next target, especially if it has somehow displeased the self-proclaimed masters of the universe. We all remember the wars of aggression that were unleashed far from American shores and on far-fetched pretexts in Yugoslavia, Iraq and Libya, claiming the lives of hundreds of thousands of peaceful civilians. Were the West’s legitimate interests really at stake in even one of those countries? Were there bans there on English or other languages of NATO’s member States, or on the Western media or culture? Were Anglo-Saxons declared subhuman and heavy weapons used against them? What became of the United States’ adventurism in the Middle East? Has it improved the human rights situation or the rule of law? Has it stabilized the socioeconomic situation or improved people’s welfare? Name one country where life has changed for the better as a result of Washington’s interference by force.",RUS_2022_03
RUS,2022,"In its attempts to revive a unipolar model under the banner of a rules-based order, the West has established dividing lines everywhere based on the notion of confrontation between blocs and the spirit of “either you are with us or against us”. There is no third option or possibility for compromise. In a continuation of its irrational policy of expanding NATO eastward and bringing NATO’s military infrastructure close to the borders of Russia, the United States now wants to subjugate Asia. At the NATO summit in June in Madrid, the self-proclaimed defensive alliance declared the security of the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions indivisible. Closed frameworks are being created under the banner of Indo-Pacific strategies that undermine the entire open and inclusive regional architecture that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations has built over decades.

Its tool for coercing those who disagree is illegal unilateral sanctions, which for many years now have been used in violation of the Charter of the United Nations as an instrument of political blackmail. The cynicism of that practice is obvious, since the restrictions affect civilians, preventing their access to basic goods, including medicines, vaccines and food. One such egregious example is the United States’ blockade of Cuba, which has gone on for more than 60 years, and whose lifting an overwhelming majority of the General Assembly has been demanding urgently for decades. The Secretary-General, whose duties include facilitating the implementation of the General Assembly resolutions, should of course give that issue special attention.",RUS_2022_05

Defying elementary common sense, Washington and Brussels have compounded the situation by declaring an economic war against Russia, and the result has been higher prices globally for food, fertilizer, oil and gas. We welcomed the Secretary-General’s efforts to help broker the Istanbul agreements of 22 July, but those agreements have to be implemented. So far, most of the ships carrying Ukrainian grain have not been directed to the poorest countries, and the financial and logistical obstacles to Russia’s exports of grain and fertilizer imposed by the United States and the EU have not been completely removed.

How have Russia’s actions over the past decades actually encroached on its opponents’ interests? Could it be that they cannot forgive the fact that Russia’s position made the military and strategic detente of the 1980s and ’90s possible? Or is it that we voluntarily dissolved the Warsaw Treaty Organization, thereby depriving NATO of its raison d’etre? Or that contrary to positions in London and Paris, we supported German reunification unconditionally? Or withdrew our armed forces from Europe, Asia and Latin America, and recognized the independence of the former Soviet republics? Or believed Western leaders’ promises that they would not expand NATO eastward by an inch, and when the process started, we agreed to basically legitimize it by signing a Founding Act between Russia and NATO? Did we perhaps encroach on the West’s interests when we warned that bringing its military infrastructure closer to our borders was unacceptable?",RUS_2022_07

The West simply threw up its hands and looked on in silence as the putschists began bombing eastern Ukraine, where people refused to accept the results of the coup, just as they did when its organizers elevated the Nazi accomplices who took part in the brutal ethnic cleansing of Russians, Poles and Jews during the Second World War to the rank of national heroes. Were we supposed to stand idly by in the face of Kyiv’s policies imposing a total ban on the Russian language and on Russian education, media and culture, demanding that Russians be expelled from Crimea and declaring war on the Donbas — whose residents the Kyiv authorities, then and now, in the words of their most senior officials, have pronounced to be not people but mere creatures? Perhaps Russia was interfering with Western interests when it played a key role in stopping the hostilities unleashed by Kyiv’s neo-Nazis in eastern Ukraine and then insisted on the implementation of the Minsk package of measures — which was adopted unanimously by the Security Council in February 2015 but then killed by Kyiv with the direct involvement of the United States and the EU?",RUS_2022_10

The operation is being carried out in accordance with the treaties of friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance reached between Russia and those republics on the basis of Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations.

That is what the residents of those regions are doing now, and they are taking the lands where their forefathers lived for centuries with them. It is very clear to any unbiased observer that for the Anglo-Saxons, who have completely subjugated Europe, Ukraine is merely expendable material in their fight against Russia. NATO has declared that our country poses an immediate threat to the United States’ quest for total dominance and that China is a long-term strategic challenge.

The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has been virtually privatized. There are fierce attempts being made to undermine efforts to set up a mechanism within the Biological Weapons Convention to ensure the transparency of the hundreds of military biological programmes that the Pentagon has around the world, including along Russia’s borders and throughout Eurasia.

An intolerable situation has developed around Washington’s failure to meet its obligations, as the host country, under the Agreement between the United Nations and the United States of America regarding the Headquarters of the United Nations, to provide normal conditions for the participation of all Member States in the work of the United Nations.

The situation with Ukraine is a very recent example of that. Russia has expounded the basis for its position in detail for the past several years, and the West has expressed its disagreement with it. It should then be up to the other members of the international community to decide what position to take and whether to support one side or the other or remain neutral. That is usually what is done in democracies when opposing politicians make their case to try to win popular support. But the United States and its allies give no one the freedom to choose. They threaten and arm-twist anyone who dares to think independently. They use threats to force others to join sanctions against Russia.

We are working to revive the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action for Iran’s nuclear programme in its original form, and to bring about a just and comprehensive resolution of the problems on the Korean peninsula. The multiple conflicts in Africa demand that we resist the temptation to play a geopolitical zero-sum game there and instead consolidate external players in support of the African Union’s initiatives.

They call on all of us to assume our individual and collective responsibility to create the conditions needed to ensure that succeeding generations develop in safety and harmony. For that to happen, everyone will have to demonstrate political will.

The calling card, so to speak, of the collective West has long been a refusal to accept the principle of equality and a total unwillingness to negotiate. Accustomed to looking down on the rest of the world. Americans and Europeans constantly make all kinds of promises and undertake obligations — including written and legally binding ones — and then simply do not fulfil them.

In 1945. when together with Washington and London we were defeating the enemy on the front lines of the Second World War. our allies in the anti-Hitler coalition were already planning a military operation — Operation Unthinkable — against the Soviet Union. Four years later, in 1949. the Americans developed Operation Dropshot, designed to launch massive nuclear strikes on the Soviet Union. Those insane plans remained on paper, and the Soviet Union created its own retaliatory weapon. It took the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. when the world teetered on the brink of a nuclear war. for the idea of unleashing such weapons and the illusion that they could bring victory to cease to be a basis for the United States’ military planning.",RUS_2023_02
RUS,2023,"When the Cold War ended, the Soviet Union played a decisive role in the unification of Germany and the agreement on the parameters of a new security architecture in Europe. Furthermore, the Soviet leadership, and Russia’s leaders after them, were given specific political assurances regarding the non-expansion eastward of the NATO military bloc. The corresponding records of those negotiations are in both our archives and those of the West, and are publicly available. But those Western leaders’ assurances turned out to be fraudulent. They had no intention of fulfilling them. Meanwhile, they were not in the least embarrassed by the fact that by bringing NATO closer to Russia’s borders, they were flagrantly violating the official commitments, made at the highest level in accordance with Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe policy, to refraining from strengthening their own security at others’ expense or allowing any country, group of countries or organization to achieve military and political dominance in Europe.",RUS_2023_03

The recent series of joint exercises between the United States and its European NATO allies, including testing scenarios for the use of nuclear weapons on the territory of the Russian Federation, is a precedent unseen since the end of the Cold War. The obsessive insistence on fulfilling stated aim of inflicting “strategic defeat” on Russia decidedly blinded those irresponsible politicians who while they believe in their own impunity have lost the most basic sense of self-preservation.",RUS_2023_04

To that end. Washington is creating subordinate, mini military and political alliances such as the Australia- United Kingdom-United States troika AUKUS. the United States-Japan-Republic of Korea trio and the Tokyo-Seoul-Canberra-Wellington quartet, pushing the participants into practical cooperation with NATO, which introduces its infrastructure into the Pacific theatre. Those efforts, which are openly designed to target Russia and China and bring about the collapse of the inclusive regional architecture that has arisen around the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, create a risk of the emergence of a new. explosive hotbed of geopolitical tension in addition to that in Europe, which has already reached boiling point.",RUS_2023_05

Those plans are both illusory and extremely dangerous, but that has not stopped the ideologists behind the new edition of the Pax Americana. The global minority is doing its utmost to slow the natural course of events. The Vilnius Summit communique issued by NATO Heads of State and Government characterizes what it calls “the deepening strategic partnership” between China and Russia as a threat to NATO. Speaking recently to his ambassadors abroad. President Macron of France expressed genuine concern about the potential expansion of the group made up of Brazil. Russia. India.

They want to be friends and trade among themselves, but with the rest of the world as well — just on an equal footing and to the mutual benefit of all.

As far as Russia is concerned, there is clearly no alternative to that. However, the United States and its subordinates in the collective West continue to multiply conflicts that divide humankind artificially into hostile blocs and prevent us from achieving our shared goals.

But the West still considers itself superior to the rest of humankind, as illustrated by an already notorious statement by the chief diplomat of the European Union (EU). Josep Borrell Fontelles. when he said that “Europe is a [blossoming] garden... [and] most of the rest of the world is a jungle”. He is not bothered by the fact that Islamophobia and other forms of intolerance of the traditional values of every world religion run rampant in that garden.

We continue to insist on an immediate and total end to the United States’ unprecedentedly inhumane trade. economic and financial blockade of Cuba and on rescinding the absurd decision to declare Cuba a State sponsor of terrorism. Washington must abandon its policy of economic strangulation of Venezuela, without preconditions of any kind. We demand the lifting of the unilateral sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union on the Syrian Arab Republic, which are egregiously undermining its right to development.

The Palestinians have been waiting for the State that was solemnly promised to them for more than 70 years, but the Americans, who have monopolized the mediation process, have done everything they can to prevent it. We call on all responsible countries to unite their efforts to create the conditions for a resumption of direct Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. It is encouraging that the League of Arab States has got a second wind and is revitalizing its role in regional affairs. We welcome Syria’s return to the Arab family and the normalization process that has begun between Damascus and Ankara, which we are trying to assist in together with our Iranian colleagues.

And now the European Union does not want to make its Kosovo proteges implement the 2013 agreements between Belgrade and Pristina on establishing a community of Serbian municipalities in Kosovo, with special rights regarding their language and traditions. In both cases, the EU was the guarantor of the agreements, and apparently they have shared the same fate. Like so-called sponsor, like result. Together with Washington. Brussels is now imposing its so- called mediation services on Azerbaijan and Armenia and helping to destabilize the South Caucasus.

The work of the Dispute Settlement Body of the World Trade Organization should also be immediately unblocked. The expansion of the composition of the Security Council is also becoming increasingly important.

ZAF,2012,"Today’s timely debate is a reminder that, ultimately, peace is a choice. Peace is achievable. The wise and brave choices we have the power to make can deliver lasting peace to every corner of the world. We are called upon at this sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly to choose peace by reforming and strengthening the United Nations so that it can play its rightful role and deliver peace, security, sustainable development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the world. As the foremost multilateral forum bringing together all nations of the world, the United Nations is best placed to play this role. It requires our support as Member States at all times, both for our sake and for that of future generations.",ZAF_2012_33
ZAF,2013,It is an honour and a privilege for me to once again address this body. South Africa attaches the utmost importance to the General Assembly as the most representative and democratic organ of the United Nations serving the international community.,ZAF_2013_01
ZAF,2013,We congratulate President Ashe and the Republic of Antigua and Barbuda on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. We also thank Mr. Vuk Jeremi. for the splendid way in which he presided over the Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.,ZAF_2013_02
ZAF,2013,"Let me begin by reiterating our condemnation of the horrific terrorist attack over the weekend in Kenya, in which a number of civilians, including a South African national, were killed. We express our deepest condolences to the Government and people of Kenya and to all those families who lost loved ones, and wish the wounded survivors a speedy recovery. We continue to support the efforts of Kenya and the international community aimed at peacekeeping, stability, democracy and nation-building in Somalia.",ZAF_2013_03
ZAF,2013,"The theme for our debate this year, “The post- 2015 development agenda: setting the stage”, is most appropriate. In the year 2000, the commitment was made by world leaders in the Millennium Declaration to eradicate extreme poverty and adopt the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The MDGs are measurable and achievable targets that were specifically crafted to address the most pressing development needs of the most vulnerable countries. The full implementation of the MDGs remains the key priority on the development agenda for the next two years.",ZAF_2013_04
ZAF,2013,"A development agenda for beyond 2015 should allow individual regions and States the space to address the development needs peculiar to their circumstances and priorities. For Africa in particular, the future development agenda should address poverty eradication, income inequality and job creation. We furthermore believe that the new development agenda can be effective only if it is focused on all three dimensions of sustainable development, namely, the eradication of poverty through economic development, social development and environmental sustainability.",ZAF_2013_05
ZAF,2013,"We also wish to emphasize that any development agenda beyond 2015 must be based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities in order to equalize the international playing field. We raise this point out of our concern that the global economic meltdown seems to have brought about new developments that are detrimental to the developing world, especially Africa. Some of the new developments include the tendency to renegotiate the rules of the game. New issues are being introduced as prerequisites for development and partnerships and have, in fact, become huge non-tariff barriers. They include the green economy and clean technology. While those issues are important for Africa and developing countries and need to be attended to, the manner in which they have been crafted restrains economic development, as they are used as obstacles.",ZAF_2013_06
ZAF,2013,"We also wish to emphasize our expectations that the developed North and developing South will continue to engage in a genuine partnership. In that regard, the developed North countries should stand ready to meet their commitment to contribute 0.7 per cent of their gross national income to official development assistance.",ZAF_2013_07
ZAF,2013,"We are aware of the challenges in the North caused by the economic meltdown, but we are of the view that investing in development in the South, especially in Africa, is of primary importance as a source of much- needed sustainable development and stability in the world. Attempts to delegate some of those historical responsibilities to new emerging economies in the South are unacceptable and unworkable, as such emerging nations have their own historical challenges and backlogs to deal with. Furthermore, any commitment we make to the future beyond 2015 must build on existing agreements, which include Agenda 21, the MDGs, the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and the outcome document of the Rio de Janeiro Conference on Sustainable Development. In the case of Africa, they must build on the New Partnership for Africa’s Development.",ZAF_2013_08
ZAF,2013,"Development and security are two sides of the same coin. The best way to ensure both is through good governance and the promotion of democratic values in all societies. Allow me, therefore, to register once again our serious concern that the Security Council, almost 70 years since its establishment, remains undemocratic, unrepresentative and unfair to developing nations and small States, and disenfranchises the majority of the States Members of the United Nations, which form the majority in the General Assembly. We cannot remain beholden indefinitely to the will of an unrepresentative minority on the most important issues of international peace and security.",ZAF_2013_09
ZAF,2013,"There has been too much talk about the need for reform, with too little action.

ZAF,2013,"When discussing the Security Council, the matter of the Syrian Arab Republic comes into focus. We have expressed our dismay at the use of chemical weapons in Syria. There is no cause that could justify the use of weapons of mass destruction by anyone under any circumstances. It is, however, our strongly held view that any political transition in Syria must come about as a result of the will of the Syrian people and not through the force of arms.",ZAF_2013_11
ZAF,2013,"We welcome the recent positive developments, such as the decision by Syria to accede to the Chemical Weapons Convention and the ongoing bilateral consultations between the Russian Federation and the United States.

The international community has an opportunity to use the Syrian experience to ensure that matters of this nature are handled correctly going forward, using existing instruments within the multilateral system of global governance.",ZAF_2013_12
ZAF,2013,"Next year South Africa will celebrate its twentieth anniversary of freedom and democracy. We will forever be grateful to those in the international community, including the United Nations, who stood beside us in our long struggle for liberation.

A strong partnership with the United Nations is critical for the future we want for the people of South Africa.",ZAF_2013_13
ZAF,2013,"We also take this opportunity to thank the United Nations and the international community for their support during the recent hospitalization of our beloved founding President of the free and democratic South Africa, His Excellency Mr. Nelson Mandela. We thank them for all for their support and good wishes. The United Nations declared 18 July, his birthday, as Nelson Mandela International Day. That has become a catalyst promoting service to humankind worldwide. We thank the United Nations for that gesture. Our revered former President continues to respond to treatment at his home. His family and our people have warmly welcomed the support he continues to receive from the global community. We are humbled and very grateful for that support.",ZAF_2013_14

ZAF,2014,"We have good stories to tell about the journey of the past 15 years of implementing the MDGS. In Africa, we seized the opportunity and adopted the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), our sociodevelopment blueprint. The African Union’s Vision 2063 will, together with NEPAD and other socioeconomic development programmes, be the cornerstone and foundation of Africa’s development agenda going forward. South Africa has also made significant progress in achieving the MDGs. Reducing by half the number of people earning less than a dollar a day has been achieved, while the proportion of those experiencing hunger has also been halved. South Africa has attained Goal 2, namely, to provide access to primary education for all.",ZAF_2014_03
ZAF,2014,"By official international indicators, South Africa is also doing well on MDG 3 to promote and empower women. South Africa has recorded impressive progress through the expansion of its health infrastructure and improved access to health services for all South Africans.",ZAF_2014_04
ZAF,2014,"On the reduction of child mortality, MDG 4, and the improvement of maternal health, MDG 5, significant progress has also been recorded, but more work remains to be done. In fact. more work remains worldwide to fully achieve those goals, especially in the developing world. We have to confront the underlying root causes that continue to make it impossible for our people to have a better life.",ZAF_2014_05
ZAF,2014,"In spite of the progress that we have made thus far, reports continue to show that Africa is lagging behind in the attainment of some of the MDGs. It is for that reason that we appreciate the crafting of a post-2015 global development agenda that will carry forward the unfinished business of the MDGs. The post-2015 global development agenda will provide a frame of reference for our collective agreement on what has to be done.",ZAF_2014_06
ZAF,2014,"We reiterate that developed countries should be reliable partners and meet their commitments to development goals, such as contributing 0.7 per cent of their gross national income towards official development assistance. We say that because it does not matter what the great Organization has achieved in the past six decades if we do not deal comprehensively with the scourge of poverty, unemployment and diseases. The poor of the world will then consider everything done to have been a failure. Indeed, we would have failed in our duty if we succeed in preventing another world war but continue to have children dying of malnutrition and treatable diseases.",ZAF_2014_07
ZAF,2014,The recent outbreak of Ebola in some West African States and the number of lives that have been unnecessarily lost provide a clear example of the challenges that developing countries continue to contend with. We believe that Ebola would have been contained within a few days had the outbreak been in the developed world. But now it has become a pandemic that threatens the economies of affected African States.,ZAF_2014_08
ZAF,2014,"The outbreak has thus exposed the challenges resulting from lack of capacity, lack of infrastructure and other limited resources in Africa. We are pleased that the United Nations, under the leadership of the Secretary-General, is deploying a mission to coordinate efforts to combat the virus. South Africa stands ready to continue to provide whatever resources we have at our disposal to assist the people and Governments of our sister countries of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.",ZAF_2014_09
ZAF,2014,We add our voice in calling for more resources to be deployed so as to ensure that the virus is contained.,ZAF_2014_10
ZAF,2014,"The role of the United Nations in supporting the struggles of self-determination and freedom has been remarkable. South Africa is a shining example. Twenty years ago, President Nelson Mandela thanked all nations for support from this very podium when South Africa was readmitted to the United Nations as a free and democratic State. We are reminded of that fact on this important day, which is National Heritage Day in my country.",ZAF_2014_11
ZAF,2014,"Since 1994, South Africa has made significant progress in transforming the apartheid State into a democratic one, founded on the values of human dignity, non-discrimination, non-racialism and non-sexism, the rule of law and universal adult suffrage, as enshrined in the Constitution. Given our history and heritage, we are mindful of our historic and moral responsibility in the global struggle against racism, racial discrimination and other intolerances. We will, in this regard, continue to be at the forefront of efforts to eliminate all forms of racism, racial discrimination and any other intolerance, including xenophobia and anti-Semitism.",ZAF_2014_12

We will therefore continue to support their struggle for economic liberation.",ZAF_2014_13
ZAF,2014,"While the United Nations has done remarkably well in supporting self-determination, when it celebrates 70 years of existence next year, this body may be found wanting by the people of Palestine. The Israeli-Palestine question is one of the oldest items on the United Nations agenda, but progress remains elusive. In the past few months in particular, the world has witnessed a devastating conflict that left a humanitarian crisis of shocking proportions. People in Palestine were left homeless, with no medical facilities, no safe drinking water, bereaved and having to care for the wounded after a trail of destructive military actions by Israel.",ZAF_2014_14
ZAF,2014,"South Africa has condemned the actions of both Israel and Hamas, and we have called for an immediate cessation of hostilities. Our strongly held view is that there can be no military solution to the Israeli- Palestinian question. We should all remain committed to the two-State solution, based on the 1967 borders, with Palestine and Israel coexisting side by side in peace.",ZAF_2014_15
ZAF,2014,"Of concern in this matter has been the helplessness displayed by the United Nations, especially the Security Council during the current conflict.

ZAF,2014,"Let me reiterate that the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations next year provides an opportunity for us seriously to reflect on the need to reform this august body, moving beyond words to action. Ten years ago, world leaders celebrating the sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations agreed on the need for reform of the Security Council in particular. The decision remains valid and must be implemented. When we convene here next year, in the seventieth year of the United Nations, we should be able to adopt a concrete programme that will guide us towards a strengthened United Nations and a reformed Security Council. Some contentious aspects of the United Nations system, including the power of veto and the exclusion of regions such as Africa from the Security Council, are some of the critical matters that cannot be ignored in the quest for transformation.",ZAF_2014_18
ZAF,2014,"Among the achievements of the Organization in its recent history is the cooperation between the African Union and the United Nations, particularly since the formation of the African Union Peace and Security Architecture. In this regard, the full implementation of Security Council resolutions 1809 (2008) and 2033 (2012), on cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations, particularly the African Union, remains crucial. Progress has been made in a number of areas where this cooperation is in place, for example in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The two affected subregional organizations, the Southern African Development Community and the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, continue to take significant strides with the support of the United Nations.",ZAF_2014_19

We will continue to work with the world to promote Madiba’s legacy and passion for justice, freedom, equality and human rights. We are grateful to the General Assembly and the President of the Assembly at the sixty-eighth session for the decision to establish the United Nations Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela Prize that will be awarded to an outstanding individual who will have demonstrated a commitment to the aims, objectives and principles of the United Nations Charter.

Many other eminent South Africans were provided an opportunity in various United Nations forums to state our case for freedom, the United Nations providing a voice to the voiceless. A free South Africa has also been honoured by the declaration of 18 July as International Mandela Day, honouring our founding President and world icon, President Nelson Mandela.

In an historic and landmark development the General Assembly approved a resolution to allow the Palestinian flag to fly in front of United Nations Headquarters (resolution 69/320). The resolution was passed by an overwhelming margin, supported by many nations from both the developed North and the developing South. There can be no peace, security and development in the Middle East without a resolution of the Palestinian question. A solution is urgent. Otherwise, if we delay, in the next decade we may no longer have a piece of land to justify the two- State solution.",ZAF_2015_06
ZAF,2015,"The historic seventieth anniversary of the United Nations presents an opportunity to reflect on the structure and workings of the Organization.

ZAF,2015,"A number of significant decisions on reform have been successfully implemented since that Summit. They include the following: the replacement of the Human Rights Commission with a more effective Human Rights Council, the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission as a subsidiary body of both the General Assembly and the Security Council, the reform and streamlining of the United Nations management system, the mainstreaming of gender equality through the establishment of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women),and the membership-driven responsibility to protect and to assist populations facing genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and ethnic cleansing. We welcome that notable progress.",ZAF_2015_08
ZAF,2015,"However, almost no progress has been made on the commitment also made by Heads of State and Government in 2005 to the early reform of the Security Council. It is unacceptable and unjustifiable that more than 1 billion people in the African continent are still excluded from permanent membership in the key decision-making structure of the United Nations, the Security Council.",ZAF_2015_09
ZAF,2015,"A continent with a smaller population than Africa is represented by three countries on the Security Council as permanent members. That is unfair. The United Nations cannot pretend that the world has not changed since 1945. We are no longer colonies. We are free, independent sovereign States. We welcome the fact that the push for the reform of the Security Council coming from Africa has had an impact and has given some impetus to the intergovernmental negotiations process that has been looking at the reforms. We will continue working with progressive States towards the expansion of representation.",ZAF_2015_10

Additionally, while the 2030 Agenda is universal in its scope in that the Sustainable Development Goals adopted apply to both developed and developing countries, there is also a clear recognition of the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and capabilities. The Agenda also contains a specific Goal on achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls.

As we mark this historic anniversary, the reform of the Security Council and the strengthening of the General Assembly and other organs remain a paramount concern. By the end of this session, we should be in a position to adopt a road map, with clear and implementable time frames, on the priorities of this Organization as well as on its reform. We need to do this in order for the United Nations to remain a relevant force and a force for change in the world.",ZAF_2015_26
ZAF,2015,"In conclusion, let me express our deep appreciation of the offer made by China when it was addressing the Assembly, an offer that must go through the United Nations. China spelled out the support it intended to give to Africa: a total of $100 million of free military assistance to the African Union over the next five years to support the establishment of the African Standby Force and the African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises. We would like to underline our gratitude to China.",ZAF_2015_27
ZAF,2016,I wish to congratulate the President on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. I assure him of South Africa’s continued support in the implementation of his priorities and responsibilities throughout his term. We also commend Mr. Mogens Lykketoft of Denmark for his able stewardship of the General Assembly during its historic seventieth session.,ZAF_2016_01
ZAF,2016,"The year 2016 is an important year in South Africa, as we mark two significant historic anniversaries in our country. We recently marked the sixtieth anniversary of the 1956 Women’s March against discriminatory and racist laws, and the fortieth anniversary of the youth uprising against apartheid of 16 June 1976. Those two events marked significant turning points in the history of our struggle against apartheid minority rule in our country. The Women’s March brought into sharp focus the gender dimension of the struggle and the equal role of women in the fight against white domination, oppression and injustice. Equally, the youth uprising 40 years ago highlighted and cemented the role of young people in fighting for liberation and a better society.",ZAF_2016_02
ZAF,2016,"We are reminded of those two milestones as we address the theme of this debate: “The Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world”. Last year, world leaders marked the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations by adopting the 2030 Agenda, that is, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We committed ourselves to an ambitious and transformative global development programme that seeks to address the triple challenge of this century, which is poverty, unemployment and inequality. To a great extent, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) played a critical role in galvanizing Governments and communities all over the world to put in place programmes and policies aimed at poverty eradication and addressing socioeconomic development, particularly in Africa.",ZAF_2016_03
ZAF,2016,"It is a well-known reality that our continent, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, did not achieve the targets that were set in the MDGs. It was for that reason that we insisted that the Sustainable Development Goals should continue the unfinished business of the MDGs. We therefore have an interest in ensuring the full implementation of the SDGs as we take forward the agenda of promoting Africa’s sustainable development.",ZAF_2016_04
ZAF,2016,"We have made significant strides in the past couple of decades in reversing the impact of underdevelopment and the legacies of colonialism and apartheid in Africa. If the African continent is to develop faster, we need to address certain constraints. That includes inadequate infrastructure; high dependency on primary products; high exposure to commodity-price volatility; limited investment in research and development, science, innovation and technology; and low private-sector investment, as well as the need to continue improving skills. To respond to some of those constraints, the continent has embarked upon a number of initiatives, including the New Partnership for Africa’s Development, the Presidential Infrastructure Championing Initiative, the African Mining Vision and the Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa.",ZAF_2016_05
ZAF,2016,"In South Africa, we have put in place a national development plan that is aligned with both Agenda 2063 of the African Union and the Sustainable Development Goals. At the core of our development plan is a focus on poverty eradication and raising the standard of living of our people. Our national development plan is also in line with the drive for the industrialization of Africa. That will contribute to eradicating poverty and reducing inequality and unemployment, and will also contribute to global growth and prosperity. It is therefore imperative that Africa and the least developed countries, which were left behind in previous industrialisation processes, not be excluded from the fourth, or new, industrial revolution.",ZAF_2016_06
ZAF,2016,"The successful implementation of Africa’s development plans depends on the availability of resources. We are therefore seriously concerned about the loss of the continent’s resources through illicit financial flows. The joint African Union-United Nations Economic Commission for Africa High-level Panel on Illicit Financial Flows from Africa estimates that illicit flows from Africa could amount to as much as $50 billion per year. Illicit financial flows deprive developing countries of economic resources that are much needed to uplift their economies in order to provide infrastructure and basic services, such as education and health care. We urge the world at large to treat this problem with the seriousness and urgency that it deserves.",ZAF_2016_07
ZAF,2016,"We also need to close the gap that has painfully divided people between rich and the poor and divided countries between big and small economies. Global inequality and economic exclusion have become a serious threat to global peace and stability. Inclusive growth is therefore a peace, security and prosperity imperative. However, inclusive growth will remain a distant dream if powerful nations continue to put their national interests ahead of the global collective interest.",ZAF_2016_08
ZAF,2016,"The African continent remains committed, through the African Union and its Peace and Security Architecture, to resolving the remaining conflicts. We have committed ourselves to silencing the guns by 2020. We appeal to the Security Council in particular to support African peace operations so that we can achieve that noble goal. The situations in Libya, South Sudan and the Central African Republic remain a continental priority. We strongly urge the Security Council to better align and coordinate with the African Union in efforts to bring about peace in those sister countries and on the continent at large.",ZAF_2016_09
ZAF,2016,"Beyond the continent, we remain concerned about threats of terrorism. Fifteen years after the 11 September terrorist attacks on the United States, international terrorism remains a challenge that no single country or region has been able to deal with successfully. We have witnessed the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant and are horrified by its brutal and senseless killings. The conflicts in both Libya and Syria have provided fertile ground for the terrorists to carry out their unjustified terrorist activities.",ZAF_2016_10
ZAF,2016,"In less than five years, the conflict in Syria has led to chaos in that country, with a devastating effect on the stability of the region. The deadlock in the Security Council on the Syrian question exposes the inherent structural dysfunction of the 1945 post-Second World War consensus. We must therefore ask ourselves if the United Nations, and particularly the Security Council as currently configured, can fulfil its mandate in addressing the challenges of the twenty-first century.",ZAF_2016_11
ZAF,2016,"The Security Council is supposed to act in our collective interests, without being bogged down by the narrow domestic interests of a few States. It is imperative and urgent that the United Nations be reformed, and in particular the Council. South Africa has been calling, and will continue to call, for fundamental reform of the Security Council in order to ensure the representation of Africa. One billion people cannot continue to be denied a voice in this manner.",ZAF_2016_12
ZAF,2016,"The lack of progress in finding a durable solution to the Palestinian question and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic’s struggle for self-determination remains of major concern for us.

ZAF,2016,"The signing of the Paris Agreement last year marked a historic moment in humankind’s resolve to minimize the impact of climate change and address the human contribution to it. I would like to take this opportunity to commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the extraordinary leadership that he provided since the fifteenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Copenhagen. He was unwavering in his commitment to seeing a legally binding agreement finally agreed to by all. The adoption of the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action, during the seventeenth Conference of the Parties, was a historic milestone and marked a turning point in the negotiation of a legally binding instrument. It provided a clear road map with targets and deadlines.",ZAF_2016_14

We wish him well in his future endeavours.",ZAF_2016_15
ZAF,2016,"We are pleased that for the first time in the history of the United Nations the General Assembly has been at the centre of the process of finding a new Secretary- General. We believe in a balanced and equal role between the two principal organs of the United Nations on the question of the selection of the Secretary-General. The General Assembly, as the most representative organ, representing all the aspirations of the peoples of the world, should be central in determining the right man or woman to lead the United Nations into the future. The General Assembly cannot be expected just to rubber-stamp decisions of the Security Council. South Africa is particularly supportive of the proposal to limit the term of office of the Secretary-General to a seven- year non-renewable term in order to allow him or her to work without being concerned about reappointment.",ZAF_2016_16

ZAF,2017,"The current structure of the global economy continues to deepen the divide between the Global North and Global South.While a few enjoy the benefits of globalization, the majority of the peoples of the world still live in abject poverty and hunger, with no hope of ever improving their living conditions. Even within developed countries, the gap between rich and poor remains wide and is of serious concern. We need political will and commitment from global leaders to address the challenges and obstacles posed by the untransformed structure of the global economy, if we hope to achieve the goals and ambitions of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.",ZAF_2017_05

ZAF,2017,"Money laundering, tax evasion and tax avoidance, corruption and transfer pricing by multinational companies are some of the biggest challenges to economic growth and stability. They undermine the integrity of the global financial system, efficient tax collection and equitable allocation of resources. We appeal for the cooperation and commitment of every State Member of the United Nations and the international community at large to address that phenomenon. Developed countries in particular have a historical and moral obligation to contribute to achieving a fair global economic environment and to eradicate the scourge of illicit financial flows from the continent.",ZAF_2017_08
ZAF,2017,"The United Nations should also play a central role in addressing this problem. We therefore welcome the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 71/213, entitled “Promotion on international cooperation to combat illicit financial flows in order to foster sustainable development”. It is a preliminary step towards a global architecture to tackle the scourge and impacts of illicit financial flows.",ZAF_2017_09

We welcome the continued support for the AU’s efforts to resolve conflicts on the African continent through promoting African solutions to African problems and challenges. As Africans, we are doing everything possible to reach our goal of silencing the guns by 2020, as set out in our Agenda 2063, a continental blueprint for a peaceful, prosperous and democratic Africa. In that regard, we continue to make significant progress in resolving challenges to peace and security in our continent.",ZAF_2017_10
ZAF,2017,"We hope that soon the sister people of Libya will be able to live in peace and harmony in a united and democratic country. In 2011, the African Union called for dialogue to resolve the crisis in Libya. Unfortunately, some of us present here opted for guns and bombs, and today those countries are making little effort to promote stability in Libya. The major focus and preoccupation has become how to deal with the flow of migrants arriving in Europe from our continent and the Middle East, which is a mere symptom. The war in Libya has contributed a great deal to the destabilization of the Sahel region all the way to Central Africa, creating a corridor for illicit arms trafficking and terrorist activities. In fact, had our warning been heeded that the supply of arms to civilians in Libya and the arming of civilians in Syria would cause loss of life, great instability and mayhem, the world would be more peaceful today.",ZAF_2017_11
ZAF,2017,South Africa continues to call for an immediate end to the violence and for a Syrian-led political transition and a negotiated settlement that reflects the will of the Syrian people. In both instances — of Libya and Syria — we strongly cautioned against seeking to resolve internal challenges of sovereign States by imposing foreign solutions through military means. It is hoped that lessons will be learned from those tragic episodes in order to make the world a more peaceful place.,ZAF_2017_12
ZAF,2017,"We continue our call for calm on the Korean peninsula. The situation cannot be allowed to get out of hand. As a country that voluntarily dismantled its nuclear-weapon programme, South Africa is of the firm view that there are no safe hands for weapons of mass destruction. The only viable solution to the problems of nuclear weapons is their total elimination, as expressed in the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, recently adopted by the United Nations conference to negotiate a legally binding instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons, leading towards their total elimination. It can no longer be acceptable that a few countries maintain arsenals and stockpiles of nuclear weapons as part of their strategic defence and security doctrine, while expecting others to remain at their mercy. We are concerned that any possible accidental detonation would lead to a disaster of epic proportions.",ZAF_2017_13

At the same time, we reaffirm the inalienable right of States to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, as reinforced in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.

ZAF,2017,"For South Africa, the seventy-second session of the General Assembly coincides with the centenary of Oliver Reginald Tambo, who led our liberation movement, the African National Congress, for three decades in the struggle against apartheid and racism in South Africa. O.R. Tambo travelled all over the continent of Africa and the globe, mobilizing international support for the struggle against racial discrimination and the oppressive apartheid regime. He strongly believed in the role of multilateralism and in the centrality of the United Nations. It was for that reason that he spent a lot of time in the rooms and corridors of this United Nations building, mobilizing members to take firm action against the apartheid regime in South Africa. As we celebrate what would have been O.R. Tambo’s one-hundredth birthday, we take this opportunity as a country once again to thank the United Nations and the international community for their support for and solidarity with our struggle for liberation.",ZAF_2017_17
ZAF,2017,"If O.R. Tambo were still alive today, he would have pleaded with the Organization to do all it can to support the struggle of the Palestinian people against occupation and to support the struggle of the people of Western Sahara. The world has preached a two-State solution for the situation in Palestine, yet we have seen the expansion of illegal settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory. We appeal to the General Assembly that the same resolve shown in supporting the South African struggle for liberation should be shown towards ending the apartheid practices against the people of Palestine.",ZAF_2017_18
ZAF,2017,"We also wish to remind the General Assembly that the right of the people of Western Sahara to self- determination continues to be undermined, challenged and denied.

We are bound to ask what contribution the United Nations has made to a more peaceful, more prosperous and more equal world. More important, we are called upon to ask — as we did yesterday during the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit (see A/73/PV.5), which was held here — what the United Nations and the assembled global leadership must do to secure lasting peace, reconciliation and stability across the globe.",ZAF_2018_02

It reflects a new and sincere commitment by the world’s leaders to comprehensively advance peace and security and resolve all conflicts and wars.

With the support of the United Nations, 24 years ago, we as South Africans were able to  bring an  end  to the nightmare of apartheid. Nelson Mandela led us to freedom and gave us the great opportunity to transform our country.

Even as our country is experiencing difficult economic challenges, we  have made progress. We are reforming our economy and creating an environment that is conducive to investment and have embarked upon an investment drive to attract $100 billion in the next five years.

That places a responsibility on us as leaders not only to put the interests of young people at the centre of our efforts, but also to empower women and young people to be more prominent in directing the course of global affairs. It is young people who are fighting the wars that we started. It is women who are bearing the brunt and hardships of the wars that continue to destroy their lives and their families.

We need a deliberate programme to ensure that the digital revolution, which carries such great potential for both disruption and empowerment, is effectively harnessed to promote social justice as well as human progress.

It was therefore with no great surprise that a democratic South Africa eagerly pursued its new international role and enthusiastically took up its responsibilities as an active Member of the United Nations.",ZAF_2019_05
ZAF,2019,"We have sought to participate in all aspects of the United Nations, including by serving in its principal organs. The principles that motivate our action derive from a firm belief in multilateralism, especially a global governance system that is fair, equitable and representative; the promotion of peace and security through global disarmament, the peaceful settlement of disputes and the promotion of good governance; the promotion of human rights; and the fight against poverty through the promotion of sustainable development. We strongly believe that a purposive system of multilateralism is necessary to deal with the global challenges we confront us. We are all interdependent in an ever more globalized world, and we can ill afford the pursuit of narrow self-interests.",ZAF_2019_06
ZAF,2019,"Today, South Africa is able to partner with the United Nations in addressing the injustice and imbalances that are a legacy of our past. As Government and civil society in South Africa, we respect and act on the decisions of the United Nations. This includes actions in response to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which articulate a transformative global development agenda. South Africa’s National Development Plan 2030 is the policy we have adopted to execute our commitment to achieving the SDGs. Our Plan complements our efforts to support peace, development and security on our continent and the aspirations contained in Agenda 2063 of the African Union (AU).",ZAF_2019_07
ZAF,2019,"We believe that, in order to achieve these goals, all Member States should establish partnerships, primarily with the private sector and civil society organizations, to ensure a joint commitment aimed at realizing a world free of poverty and underdevelopment.",ZAF_2019_08
ZAF,2019,"One of the greatest obstacles to building a world free of poverty and inequality is intolerance. This includes intolerance of other nations and intolerance of our fellow human beings, as well as inadequate care for the natural environment that sustains us all. Intolerance is exhibited most gruesomely by the evidence of gender-based violence and the exclusion of women from many sectors in society. Our country, South Africa, is taking urgent steps to address the scars of gender-based violence. All of us need to act urgently to ensure that we all enjoy full access to our human rights and that all our citizens, in particular, women, enjoy bodily security. We also face an existential threat due to our intolerance and the disrespect and veritable violence we inflict on the planet on which we all depend.",ZAF_2019_09
ZAF,2019,"The Organization, however, is a manifestation of the rejection of intolerance. It was created in the aftermath of a devastating world war as a global forum where nations of the world can address differences and work together for the common good of all people. Our annual gathering here in the Assembly Hall should provide us an opportunity to recommit to these important values.",ZAF_2019_10
ZAF,2019,"I firmly believe that we are all here because we are committed to the ideal of multilateral solutions to the world’s problems, which draws on strength through diversity — diversity of perspective born from differences in upbringing and culture. By being here, therefore, we recognize that we need each other and that we need to work together. We must therefore use this opportunity to rally against intolerance of any kind so that nations can live in peace and respect each other irrespective of nationality, religion, ethnic or social origin, gender or any other status. It is through our differences that we should find strength and not division.",ZAF_2019_11
ZAF,2019,"Unfortunately, our country, South Africa, has not been immune from evidence of intolerance and division in some parts of our nation. The incidents of violence and looting that erupted in parts of Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal provinces were regrettable and shameful for a nation with such a proud history of struggle and international solidarity and support. The Government of South Africa strongly condemned these tragic actions and is working hard to ensure we address the security lapses and intolerance that led to the violence. We are working tirelessly to tackle crime and lawlessness and to ensure that the arrested criminals face the full might of the law.",ZAF_2019_12
ZAF,2019,"We are also committed to addressing the inadequacy of our immigration administration in order to curb illegal migration and to make sure that everyone who comes to South Africa is documented and safe. We plan to work with all countries of the continent to ensure that we implement our development strategies and use them to create greater economic opportunities for all our people so as to diminish feelings of resentment and antipathy. Working with civil society, we will build bridges allowing all who live in South Africa to reach out to each other in order to build bonds of friendship and pan-Africanism.",ZAF_2019_13
ZAF,2019,"I am pleased that I can honestly confirm to this important global body that South Africa has an unwavering commitment to our continent, Africa. We have made dedicated efforts to contribute positively in support of peace and development on our continent, and we will continue those efforts even as we work to address the inadequacies I have referred to.",ZAF_2019_14
ZAF,2019,"Our country, South Africa, has enjoyed democracy for 25 years, and in that time the leaders and the people of South Africa have consistently acknowledged the immeasurable contribution that the people of Africa rendered in support of the struggle against apartheid. Our neighbouring States in particular, and the rest of the countries of Africa made great sacrifices in support of the liberation movements and the oppressed citizens of South Africa.",ZAF_2019_15
ZAF,2019,"We wish to reiterate that South Africa does not condone any form of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia or related intolerance. In fact, South Africa has embraced millions of migrants and refugees from all over the continent of Africa, and the majority of our people have warmly embraced their brothers and sisters from the continent. We are determined to ensure that it becomes a national embrace and is not a limited to some communities.",ZAF_2019_16
ZAF,2019,"It is an honour for us to address the General Assembly in the first year of the Nelson Mandela Decade of Peace, which the Assembly last year agreed would run from 2019 to 2028.

South Africa therefore commits to use the Nelson Mandela Decade of Peace to promote the strengthening of multilateralism and diplomacy as effective tools for addressing the challenges facing the world today.",ZAF_2019_17
ZAF,2019,"We cannot decisively deal with the threats of poverty unless we transform the current structure of the global economy, which continues to perpetuate divisions between the global North and global South.

It is necessary for us all to work together and spare no effort in addressing the challenges brought by the impact of globalization and the untransformed structure of global economy.",ZAF_2019_18
ZAF,2019,"The issues of global peace and security continue to be one of our foremost priorities within the United Nations family.

ZAF,2019,"We are currently serving as a member of the Security Council. The theme for our term is “Continuing the legacy: working for a just and peaceful world”. That is the embodiment of the legacy of Nelson Mandela and furthers the objective of silencing the guns on the African continent by 2020. We are using our tenure to promote the maintenance of international peace and security and advocate for the peaceful settlement of disputes and inclusive dialogue. We continue to encourage closer cooperation between the Security Council and other regional and subregional organizations, particularly our African Union.",ZAF_2019_20
ZAF,2019,"We further emphasize the role of women in the resolution of conflict. We argue for a gender perspective to be mainstreamed into all Security Council resolutions, in line with Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and security, which was adopted at the initiative of our neighbour Namibia. Despite the commitments in the resolution, women remain excluded from peace processes, including in the drafting of peace agreements, and their involvement in United Nations peacekeeping is limited. We need to ensure that women are fully part of peacebuilding processes and form a part of the institutions that are established once conflict has been eradicated. In October, we will preside over the Security Council’s debate on that subject. The emphasis of the debate should be to ensure the implementation of the commitments that we have made to fully implementing the women and peace and security agenda.",ZAF_2019_21
ZAF,2019,"As we have consistently stated, South Africa is supportive of this global institution and a rules-based multilateral system, but we believe that the United Nations remains hamstrung by the fact that it continues to have structures that are undemocratic and anachronistic. We remain gravely concerned that 74 years after the founding of the United Nations, key decisions on peace and security are the de facto domain of only five countries. Twenty years of discussions on reform of the Security Council have yielded no movement towards a more representative and inclusive body.",ZAF_2019_22
ZAF,2019,"We believe that the time has come for the broader membership to heed the overwhelming call for Africa to obtain at least two permanent seats, with all the prerogatives of permanent membership, as well as five non-permanent seats, as embodied in the Common African Position, adopted in the Ezulwini Consensus. In that regard, we must see an invigoration of the negotiations on reform at the intergovernmental negotiations, including by ensuring that we move to text-based negotiations.",ZAF_2019_23
ZAF,2019,"Our continent Africa has reached an important milestone with the adoption and launch of the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement. The agreement entered into force on 30 May, and we are confident that it will unleash Africa’s economic potential and consolidate its position as a new frontier of economic growth and development. It is a flagship imitative of the AU Agenda 2063, and the trade opportunities it creates must be taken up by all member States and our partners. We are ready to engage in active deliberations on that bold step.",ZAF_2019_24
ZAF,2019,"We wish to stress that Africa’s development cannot be addressed without responding to illicit financial flows. We believe that those debilitate our efforts to generate sufficient domestic resources to support our development. We propose that we work together as the international community to establish an intergovernmental framework that would have a universal political mandate, which would serve as a basis to address those illicit flows, including speeding up the return of assets.",ZAF_2019_25
ZAF,2019,"The international community stands at a unique crossroads where the shifting international order has the ability to shape international peace and security for decades to come. It is therefore a great disappointment that we witnessed the demise of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in August. Furthermore, in the prevailing international climate, successes in the field of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, are few and far between. The threats posed by those weapons are too great for the international community to ignore. We believe that only the complete, transparent, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement of such weapons and their means of delivery can prevent their use in an escalating conflict.",ZAF_2019_26
ZAF,2019,"We feel ashamed by the fact that for over 70 years, the people of Palestine have lived under occupation. In the past year, that occupation has worsened, with continued illegal settlement activity and further insecurity for the peoples of Palestine and Israel. As the international community, we must continue to urge for a negotiated settlement to that long-standing conflict.",ZAF_2019_27

ZAF,2022,"We meet at a time when the United Nations family is facing its greatest tests. The States Members of the United Nations have to work with the Organization to develop effective responses to the current challenges. As the theme of the General Assembly indicates, those challenges are diverse, immense, yet interconnected, and no country can respond alone. Some have referred to this moment as a key turning point in history. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war strongly influence those attitudes today. However, for South Africa, the real inflection point will be a world attending fully to the needs of the marginalized and the forgotten. Our greatest global challenges are poverty, inequality joblessness and a feeling of being entirely ignored and excluded. Acting on the 2021 Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) vision of the Secretary-General should become the major objective of this time — because addressing poverty and underdevelopment will, in our view, be the beginnings of the real inflection point in human history.",ZAF_2022_02

There were some noble initiatives, such as the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A), co-chaired by President Ramaphosa of South Africa, the African Union champion for the COVID-19 response, as well as the Prime Minister of Norway.

We need to collectively address global energy shortages, including by deploying innovative solutions that are cheaper, cleaner and more accessible.

We are working on an expanded green economy intervention that is gaining significant momentum in our country.",ZAF_2022_10
ZAF,2022,"I would like to commend the Secretary-General for focusing attention during this session of the General Assembly on transforming education. Education remains one of the most important drivers to end poverty and inequality, and we will work towards increasing access to education that is affordable as a country and as a continent. South Africa has no-fee schools at primary and secondary levels to allow the most vulnerable learners to access compulsory education. We also have a State bursary scheme for poor students who qualify for tertiary education. Over the years those measures have served to increase the enrolment of learners previously unable to access education. In the field of research and innovation, we believe we need more partnerships such as the Square Kilometre Array science infrastructure project hosted in South Africa and Australia, an international partnership that is one of the largest joint scientific endeavours in history. Partnerships of that nature must be encouraged in order to leverage scientific breakthroughs for development purposes.",ZAF_2022_11
ZAF,2022,"We also believe that the multilateral trading system must be strengthened so that we can create an environment that is genuinely conducive to fair trade and provides opportunities for developing economies. If actionable steps such as those are not taken, developing countries will remain subject to an unbalanced global financial and trading system. Let us use this moment of renewal to reiterate our commitment to multilateralism as the only means for building a better world. The United Nations itself must of course be transformed so that it fulfils its role in a way that is cognizant of current global dynamics. It is unacceptable that 77 years after the establishment of the United Nations, five nations wield disproportionate decision-making power in the system as a whole. Its transformation must include more representative, transparent and accountable organs of global governance. In order for our Organization to be effective, the General Assembly must be revitalized and the Security Council reformed. Nor will we have a credible Organization if it cannot hold persistent transgressors of the Charter accountable.",ZAF_2022_12
ZAF,2022,"We believe we must act immediately to protect the environment and the world we live in, for ourselves and future generations. While Africa is the region least responsible for the climate crisis, it finds itself at the epicentre of its worst impacts. We should therefore emerge from the twenty-seventh Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 27), in Egypt, with an agreement that contains enhanced and balanced actions on adaptation, mitigation and financing. It must of course take into account our common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. In addition, we must agree at COP 27 on a mechanism for loss and change. In South Africa, our Cabinet has approved wide-ranging policies to ensure that we can meet our newly determined climate-change targets. We have established a climate finance task team to lead and coordinate negotiations with international partner groups in order to give effect to the Just Energy Transition Partnership, which seeks to address South Africa’s investment needs in infrastructure with the aim of facilitating our phase-down of coal so as to ensure that no one is left behind.",ZAF_2022_13
ZAF,2022,"I do not need to reiterate that building a better world requires peace and stability. South Africa continues to believe that conflict resolution should not come through fuelling conflicts but through investing in efforts aimed at political dialogue. We should aspire to peace as a global public good. There have been no winners of the wars of the past seven decades. Instead, they have engendered strife, distrust among nations, divisions — as we are seeing this week — a perpetual misallocation of resources to weapons, and increased poverty and underdevelopment. Those are all features and effects of war.",ZAF_2022_14
ZAF,2022,"While we work to address contemporary clashes, we should not ignore long-standing conflicts such as that of the people of Palestine, which has been on the United Nations agenda throughout the seven decades of the Organization’s existence. We cannot ignore the words of Daniel Levy, the former Israeli negotiator at the Oslo talks, who addressed the Security Council recently (see S/PV.9116) and referred to the increasingly weighty body of scholarly, legal and public opinion that considers Israel to be perpetrating apartheid in the territories under its control. Israel must be held accountable for its destructive actions, which have significantly impaired the possibility of a two-State solution. Similarly, we cannot ignore the decades-long struggle for self-determination of the people of Western Sahara. We must treat all conflicts across the globe with equal indignation, no matter the colour or creed of the people affected. South Africa also calls for an end to the embargo on Cuba, which continues to impede the right to development of its people. In the same vein, we call for an end to unilateral coercive measures against Zimbabwe, which have compounded the problems experienced by its people and have a detrimental effect on the broader Southern African region.",ZAF_2022_15
ZAF,2022,"Our quest to build a better world will remain unfulfilled as long as people are still discriminated against on the basis of race, gender, sex, ethnic or social origin, colour, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture or language. We have a responsibility to make sure that every girl child receives an education and that every woman has an opportunity to work, study or start a business and has choice and control over her life and body. We must also ensure that more women speak at the General Assembly. We need to end the violence perpetrated against the most vulnerable, most often women and children. We have witnessed that women in conflict situations are particularly vulnerable, including women journalists. The murder of Shireen Abu Akleh and others is a stark reminder of the danger that women in conflict situations face. We must do all we can to protect them and make every effort to hold those who harm them accountable.",ZAF_2022_16

Our countries are establishing the conditions for the seamless flow of goods and services between African markets, as well as the growth of industry and the construction of the roads, bridges, railway lines, ports and power stations that will support growth.

Our participation in the African peace initiative, supported by seven countries from the African continent, is informed by a desire to see an end to the suffering of those most directly affected by the conflict and the millions on our continent and across the world who. as a result of the conflict, are now vulnerable to worsening hunger and deprivation.",ZAF_2023_07

In that regard, we said that issues such as the return of the children who were removed from Ukraine should be ensured. We also said that the prisoners of war should be exchanged between the two countries.
